# Workspaces

Attach a workspace capability to the agent and use `ctx.workspace` in tools:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import LocalWorkspace

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2', capabilities=[LocalWorkspace('~/project')])


@agent.tool
async def execute(ctx: RunContext[None], command: list[str]) -> str:
    result = await ctx.workspace.run(command, timeout=30)
    return result.stdout
```

`LocalWorkspace(working_dir, *, read_only=False, env=None)` runs host subprocesses and provides no
isolation: `working_dir` is only the default directory and the base for relative paths, not a jail
or a security boundary. Use it only for trusted work. `working_dir` is required; a relative path
such as `'.'` resolves against the current directory at construction, and a leading `~` is
expanded; the caller owns that directory. Commands inherit only `PATH`,
`HOME`, and the locale variables `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, and `LC_CTYPE` from the agent process, with `env` and then the per-call `env` layered on top. Never pass `os.environ` wholesale: it hands the
model's commands every secret in the process, LLM API keys included. `read_only=True` wraps it in `ReadOnlyWorkspace`. Two
`LocalWorkspace`s share the default id `local_workspace` and combine into the last one (none of
the earlier one's settings carry over); give one a distinct `id` to keep both.
Its ref is `WorkspaceRef(provider='local', id=<absolute working_dir>)` from construction (the
directory is not checked then; the first operation raises `WorkspaceUnavailableError` if it is
missing), and the capability
claims only that exact ref: a foreign ref, or a local ref for another directory, gets `None`, so message history
cannot redirect the agent to another host directory (pass `workspace='new'` to start over in the
configured one). For a single run, pass the backend instead:
`agent.run(..., workspace=LocalWorkspaceBackend('.'))`, or
`workspace=ReadOnlyWorkspace(Workspace(LocalWorkspaceBackend('.')))` for a read-only run (outside
durable execution; see below).
Without an attached workspace, operations raise `WorkspaceUnavailableError`; a capability that needs one checks
`ctx.workspace.attached` in `before_run` and raises a `UserError` naming what to attach. `Workspace` offers the same run
and file methods for every backend; `WrapperWorkspace` is the base for policy wrappers (override
operations, delegate the rest to `self.wrapped`), `ReadOnlyWorkspace` blocks commands and changes,
and `workspace.read_only` lets a tool provider leave write tools out. To disable workspace access
for a run on purpose, pass `workspace=UnavailableWorkspace(reason=...)`: its operations raise
`WorkspaceUnavailableError` with that reason, which a tool can catch as a `WorkspaceError`.

`resolve()` is textual; `realpath()` asks the environment to resolve symlinks in the existing
components (native through `SupportsRealpath`, `readlink` in the shell otherwise). With neither, it
only normalizes the text, so a path check built on it cannot see through symlinks.

Outside a durable container, an explicit backend passed through `workspace=` is used directly, and
a `Workspace` facade or wrapper (`ReadOnlyWorkspace(...)`, `result.workspace`, `ctx.workspace`) is
kept as-is (inside one, see below). An explicit
`WorkspaceRef` is offered to configured capabilities, and raises if none recognizes it.
`workspace='new'` ignores any ref in message history and asks capabilities with `ref=None` for a
fresh workspace, raising if none supplies one. With `workspace=None`, capabilities receive the
latest `ModelResponse.workspace_ref` from message history; a latest `None` suppresses older ones. History
supplies identity, not provider configuration. Precedence is: explicit `workspace=`, then the
history ref, then a fresh workspace from the capability. An agent may have several workspace
capabilities, like `resolve_model_id`: they are asked in order and the first that returns a
workspace wins (capabilities passed to the run are asked before the agent's), so listing a new provider's capability before the old one moves new conversations
while old ones continue where they started. A history ref that no capability recognizes raises
`UserError` (pass `workspace='new'` to start fresh), unless the agent has no workspace capability at
all (a summarizer given the history), which ignores it. With no ref and no supplier the run gets an
`UnavailableWorkspace` whose operations raise `WorkspaceUnavailableError` explaining how to attach one.
`get_workspace` runs before `for_run` (a capability that only a `for_run` contributes is asked
afterwards, and `for_run` may not change a selection made before it), is synchronous, and must have
no side effects or I/O. A capability must return `None` for references it does not own. A
workspace capability can't be deferred: `defer_loading=True` on one raises `UserError`.

A `WorkspaceRef` names an environment that exists, and exists only once it does. A backend built
without a ref reports `ref is None`, creates the environment on its first operation, and sets `ref`
as soon as the create call returns; a backend built with a ref attaches on its first operation and
raises `WorkspaceUnavailableError` if the environment is gone, never creating a replacement. A ref
is never a label: no name-, conversation- or uuid-derived ref before the environment exists.
`get_workspace` is the only path from a ref back to a workspace. The local backend is the one
exception where the ref precedes any operation (the directory is the environment); `working_dir()`
raises `WorkspaceUnavailableError` if the directory is missing. When a run ends, `workspace.ref` is
recorded as `workspace_ref` on its last `ModelResponse` (`None` if no environment was created). A
run without an attached workspace (an agent with no workspace capability, or
`workspace=UnavailableWorkspace(...)`) records the ref from history instead, so the next turn continues
in it; after `workspace='new'` nothing is carried forward.

The core does not create or destroy environments at run boundaries; the application owns
SDK retries (outside durable execution), cleanup, TTL and pause/stop through the provider's SDK or run hooks. `Workspace.backend` reaches
the concrete backend for provider-specific methods (not from workflow code under durable
execution). Sandbox providers (Modal, E2B, Sprites) ship as capabilities in the
[Pydantic AI Harness](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/). Check a custom backend by
subclassing `pydantic_ai.workspaces.conformance.WorkspaceBackendSuite` and providing its `backend`
fixture.

Exception contract a backend must follow: `WorkspaceUnavailableError` when the environment is gone
or unreachable (ends the run; never reaches the model); `WorkspaceTimeoutError` for a command over
its `timeout=`; builtin file errors (`FileNotFoundError`, `IsADirectoryError`, ...) for path-level
failures the model can act on; `WorkspaceReadOnlyError` for a mutation on a read-only workspace;
`WorkspaceError` for other deliberate refusals; `TypeError`/`ValueError`
for bad arguments. SDK transient errors propagate unchanged (durable engines retry them); if the SDK
cannot tell a dead environment from a failed operation, probe with `working_dir()` and raise
`WorkspaceUnavailableError`. `UserError` belongs to the facade and policy wrappers, not backends.

`result.workspace` continues with a live backend; `result.workspace.ref` lets another worker attach.

Under `TemporalDurability`, `DBOSDurability` or `PrefectDurability`, attach the workspace capability
at agent construction and nothing else is needed: in workflow code (hooks, output functions,
`result.workspace`) every `Workspace` call runs as a durable unit, and inside a unit (a
tool) `ctx.workspace` is the plain workspace, rebuilt on Temporal from the serialized ref through the
same capabilities (policy wrappers included). One `ensure` unit at run start creates or attaches the
environment and records its ref and working directory, so all units share one environment and
`working_dir()`/`resolve()` need no unit. Inside a container `workspace=` takes `None`, `'new'`, a
`WorkspaceRef`, a previous `result.workspace`, or a live instance whose ref a capability recognizes,
which is rebuilt through that capability. A wrapper around it, such as `ReadOnlyWorkspace`, is
rejected with `UserError` unless the capability rebuilds the same policy, so put policy on the capability (e.g. `LocalWorkspace(..., read_only=True)`). A
live instance without a recognized ref raises `UserError`. Workspace calls retry like capability
operations, so a command or write may repeat if a worker dies mid-call. The deprecated `TemporalAgent`/`DBOSAgent`/`PrefectAgent` wrappers refuse
workspaces in their container.

examples.
