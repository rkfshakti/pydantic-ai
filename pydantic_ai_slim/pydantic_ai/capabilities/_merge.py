"""Merging two capabilities that resolved to the same `id` into the one a run uses.

Private to the package: this is what `AbstractCapability.combine` does by default, so a capability
that wants it gets it by declaring a default `id` and writing no `combine` at all. One that wants
something else overrides `combine` and writes the merge it needs, rather than parameterizing this.

    """Merge same-class capabilities field by field, the way overlapping dicts merge.

    The `combine` implementation for a capability an agent has one of, where two of them are one
    configuration stated twice and nothing either of them states should be dropped:

    | both sides | result |
    |---|---|
    | neither states a value | unset |
    | only one states a value | that value survives |
    | both state a mapping, sequence, or set | the union, later entries winning a shared key |
    | anything else | the later value |

    `None` reads as "not stated", which is what makes a restriction survive being composed with a
    capability that doesn't mention it: `WebSearch(allowed_domains=[...])` beside a plain
    `WebSearch()` keeps the allow-list, rather than the plain one silently widening it.

    Merging starts from the last capability so the fields that can't be reconciled — and the
    subclass state `replace_no_init` carries over — are the last one's, matching the "later wins"
    fallback.

    Fields declared `compare=False` are per-run bookkeeping rather than configuration, so they are
    left as the last capability's rather than merged.

    Two limits worth knowing, both from configuration that is resolved before `combine` sees it:
    a field a `__post_init__` has already materialized (`NativeOrLocalTool` turns `native=True` into
    a tool instance and `local=None` into its default) can no longer be told apart from one the user
    stated, so those take the later value; and two objects that carry no meaningful equality (two
    stores, two clients) likewise take the later. A capability that needs either reconciled — or
    needs a numeric budget to take the *smaller* value rather than the later one — overrides
    `combine` itself.

    An attribute no field declares is a harder limit, and is refused. The table above is what the
    merge promises, and its first row is the load-bearing one: a value only one side states
    survives. That cannot hold for an attribute the merge cannot enumerate -- `replace_no_init`
    copies the last instance, so such an attribute silently takes the last value even where an
    earlier instance was the only one to state it. Refusing says so instead.

    A leading underscore exempts an attribute from that check, but only because internal state is
    not this function's business -- it is not a way to get derived state merged. Nothing here
    re-runs `__post_init__` (`replace_no_init` exists precisely to skip it), so `_count = len(...)`
    keeps the last instance's value while the field it counts holds the union. A capability with
    state derived from a merged field recomputes it in its own `combine`, the way
    `NativeOrLocalTool` rebuilds its native tool.
