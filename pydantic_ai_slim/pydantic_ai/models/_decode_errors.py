"""Map a provider response body the SDK could not decode to `ModelAPIError`.

Some gateways answer 200 with a body that isn't JSON (e.g. keep-alive whitespace before an upstream failure). Most
provider SDKs then raise their JSON decoder's error, which isn't a `ModelAPIError`, so `FallbackModel` wouldn't
fall back.
