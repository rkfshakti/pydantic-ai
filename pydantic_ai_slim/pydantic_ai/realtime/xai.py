"""xAI Grok Voice realtime API provider for speech-to-speech sessions.

Connects to `wss://api.x.ai/v1/realtime` over a WebSocket. xAI's realtime API is a deliberate clone of
the OpenAI Realtime protocol, so this provider reuses the OpenAI codec from
[`pydantic_ai.realtime.openai`][pydantic_ai.realtime.openai] — event mapping, session seeding, tool
conversion, server-VAD config, and the WebSocket connection itself — and diverges only where xAI does:

- the `session.update` shape (`voice`/`turn_detection` sit at the session top level, not nested under
  `audio` as on OpenAI's GA surface);
- input audio transcription, delivered as cumulative
  `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.updated` snapshots plus a final `.completed`, rather
  than OpenAI's incremental `.delta` events (see [`map_event`][pydantic_ai.realtime.xai.map_event]);
- native conversation resumption when a reconnect policy is configured: the provider-assigned
  `conversation.id` is reused and its replay burst is suppressed from local history;
- no output truncation at barge-in: xAI's `conversation.item.truncate` only lands once the response
  has ended, and unreliably even then, so
  [`RealtimeModelProfile.supports_output_truncation`][pydantic_ai.realtime.RealtimeModelProfile.supports_output_truncation]
  is `False` while cancellation-based interruption still works;
- no text output — the API has no response-modality control and always speaks — so
  [`RealtimeModelProfile.supports_text_output`][pydantic_ai.realtime.RealtimeModelProfile.supports_text_output]
  is `False` and `output_modality='text'` raises rather than silently coming back as audio.

Requires the `websockets` package (the `realtime` optional group), `xai-sdk` (the `xai` group, for
[`XaiProvider`][pydantic_ai.providers.xai.XaiProvider]), and `openai` (the `openai` group, whose SDK
supplies the event types the shared OpenAI codec is built on):

    Pass `provider='xai'` (the default, which reads `XAI_API_KEY`) or an
    [`XaiProvider`][pydantic_ai.providers.xai.XaiProvider] constructed with `api_key=`. A custom
    `api_host` is not supported, and a provider constructed only with `xai_client=` cannot be used
    because the WebSocket connection needs access to the API key. The realtime WebSocket URL is
    `wss://api.x.ai/v1/realtime`.

    Args:
        model: The model name, e.g. `grok-voice-latest` (which tracks the current model) or a
            pinned version like `grok-voice-think-fast-1.0`. The `model` query parameter is required by
            the server, which otherwise falls back to a default silently.
        provider: The provider to use for authentication and the base URL. Defaults to `'xai'`.
        settings: [Model settings][pydantic_ai.realtime.RealtimeModelSettings] used as defaults for
            realtime sessions. A [`reconnect`][pydantic_ai.realtime.RealtimeModelSettings.reconnect]
            policy enables xAI's native session resumption: prior turns are restored when reconnecting
            within xAI's resumption window (30 minutes of inactivity).
        profile: Optional override for the [realtime model profile][pydantic_ai.realtime.RealtimeModelProfile],
            merged over the provider's — a partial dict, or a callable taking the resolved profile and
            returning the one to use. Mirrors `profile=` on a standard
            [`Model`][pydantic_ai.models.Model], and is the escape hatch when a model name doesn't
            identify the model (e.g. an Azure deployment named something other than its model).
