"""OpenAI GPT-Live realtime support.

GPT-Live is a separate protocol from the [OpenAI Realtime API][pydantic_ai.realtime.openai], not a
model served by it, so none of its event mapping is shared: what it borrows from
`_openai_protocol.py` is the parts that are about the *provider* rather than the protocol (deriving
the WebSocket URL, resolving authentication, and mapping handshake failures). The differences that
shape the adapter:

- **Audio drives the session.** Live has no user-turn event for text: text arrives as *context*
  through `session.commentary.append` (speakable) and `session.thinking.append` (silent), each
  capped at 500 tokens. Both are placed on the session's audio timeline, which only advances while
  audio flows — so a session whose microphone isn't streaming silently defers everything sent to it.
- **There is no turn terminal.** Live has no `response.done` equivalent and no transcript-done
  event; transcripts arrive as timeline fragments. The connection synthesizes
  [`ResponseDone`][pydantic_ai.realtime.codec.ResponseDone] once the model has been quiet for
  `openai_live_turn_silence_ms` and no delegated work is outstanding, and the profile reports
  `synthesizes_turn_boundary=True` so consumers know the boundary is inferred.
- **Work is delegated, not tool-called.** The Live model hands a task either to your application
  (`client` delegation) or to a Responses backend it drives itself (`responses` delegation). Only
  the latter produces typed function calls, so it is what this adapter configures: the agent's tools
  are advertised to the backend, its calls arrive nested inside `response.event`, and their results
  go back as Responses input items. See
  [the Live docs](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/realtime/openai#gpt-live-models) for the split.
- **Usage has two meters.** Live reports its own audio as a cumulative duration in seconds and no
  tokens at all; the backend it delegates to reports ordinary Responses token usage, which is where
  most of a call's token cost is.
