"""Gemini Live API provider for realtime speech-to-speech (and live video) sessions.

Built on the `google-genai` SDK, which manages the WebSocket transport for you. Available via the
`google` optional group:

    pip install "pydantic-ai-slim[google-realtime]"

Unlike the OpenAI provider, Gemini wants **16 kHz** PCM input audio (output is 24 kHz), produces a
single response modality per session (audio *or* text), and natively accepts a stream of video
frames sent as [`BinaryImage`][pydantic_ai.messages.BinaryImage].

Use `provider='google'` for the Gemini Developer API, or `provider='google-cloud'` /
[`GoogleCloudProvider`][pydantic_ai.providers.google_cloud.GoogleCloudProvider] for Google Cloud with
Application Default Credentials.
