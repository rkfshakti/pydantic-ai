"""The OpenAI Realtime protocol's lifecycle events: which response, user turn, and input each frame is about.

`OpenAIRealtimeConnection` feeds this tracker the frames it reads and the inputs it sends, and yields the
[lifecycle events](./_lifecycle.py) it produces alongside the codec events. The protocol identifies almost
everything itself: responses have ids from `response.created` to `response.done`, spoken turns have item
ids from `input_audio_buffer.speech_started` to `.committed`, every item joins the conversation with a
`conversation.item.added`, and a `response.create`'s `metadata` comes back on the response it started.
What it doesn't identify, the tracker works out from the connection's own bookkeeping and says so
(`ResponseStarted.basis='inferred'`).

Shared by the Azure OpenAI and xAI dialects, which inherit the connection.
