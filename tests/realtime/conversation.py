"""Scripted multi-turn voice conversations for realtime tests.

A real voice app opens the microphone once and streams it for the whole call, silence between
utterances included. `speak_continuously` does the same with speech checked in under `tests/assets/`,
and `assert_conversation_invariants` checks what the history of any such conversation must satisfy,
whatever the provider.
