"""Cassette-backed tests for realtime models routed through the Pydantic AI Gateway.

These prove the gateway path end-to-end the way a user reaches it (`gateway/openai:...`): the model
connects to the gateway's realtime WebSocket, which relays the provider protocol verbatim, so the same
streamed part events and history come back as a direct connection. Recorded once against the live
gateway with `--record-mode=rewrite`, then replayed offline.

Both routes are exercised end-to-end, and they are not the same protocol: `gateway/openai` upgrades on
the OpenAI-shaped `/proxy/<route>/realtime` path, while the `google-genai` SDK behind `gateway/google`
dials the native Vertex Bidi path
(`/proxy/<route>/ws/google.cloud.aiplatform.v1beta1.LlmBidiService/BidiGenerateContent`). The gateway
handshake's URL derivation and bearer-auth injection are pinned separately in `test_google.py`
(`test_gateway_handshake_carries_bearer_auth`).
