"""Canonical cross-provider parity matrix for the realtime abstraction.

Each case is a provider route and concrete model generation. The same public-API scenarios run
unchanged for every case: a text and a spoken tool round, a history-seeded follow-up, and spoken
multi-turn conversations (over a microphone that never stops streaming, with push-to-talk, with a
barge-in, and without input transcription) checked against the same history invariants. WebSocket cassettes preserve
the real provider conversations while keeping the default suite offline.

Provider-specific wire shapes belong in the provider cassette tests. This matrix deliberately asserts
only the normalized event, message, part, usage, and profile contracts users can rely on.
