"""Cassette-backed GPT-Live WebSocket tests.

Live's wire shape differs from the Realtime API's in ways that only a real conversation exercises:
work is delegated to a Responses backend rather than tool-called directly, neither the user's turn
nor the model's reply has a terminal frame, and output audio is a continuous track rather than a
per-response stream. These record the real frames so the default suite runs offline.
