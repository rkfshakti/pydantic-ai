"""Ground truth: what the simulated provider actually saw, generated, and billed.

Every simulated server keeps one `GroundTruth`, independent of anything the client reports. The
invariants compare the session's history, usage, and waits against it. Everything the server makes is
named so a history can be mapped back onto it without guessing:

- a user text turn is the text the client sent (`t1`, `t2`, ...);
- a spoken user turn transcribes as `u1`, `u2`, ...;
- a response speaks words `r3w1 r3w2 ...` (so any recorded transcript names the response it came from)
  and calls tools with ids `call_1`, `call_2`, ...;
- usage is distinct per response, so a mis-attributed or double-counted report shows up in the sums.
