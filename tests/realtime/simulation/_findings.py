"""Known invariant violations on current main, each tied to the PR, or the structural change, that fixes it.

A violation is matched against this registry by invariant code, provider, and a predicate over the
simulation that recognizes the finding's trigger. A match is tolerated in the default exploration mode
(and counted in `_machine.KNOWN_HIT_COUNTS`) so the suite stays green on main while anything *new* still
fails; `REALTIME_SIMULATION_STRICT=1` reports them all. Each finding also has a pinned, minimal scenario
in `test_simulation.py`, marked as a strict expected failure, which starts passing when the fix lands:
then delete the finding here and turn its scenario into an ordinary regression test.

Finding ids are the ones used in the realtime stress reports and review rounds (`OR*` OpenAI Realtime,
`G*` Gemini Live, `L*` GPT-Live, `87xx #n` the n-th finding of a Codex review of that PR), so a violation
here can be traced back to its write-up.

Every finding says how well the behavior it rests on is established (`evidence`): only a `recorded` or
`live-stress` finding is a known bug; a `simulated` one may be an artifact of a fake server's guess and
needs a recording before it's treated as one. A few findings are `accepted` limitations rather than bugs:
they stay, and have no pinned scenario to retire.
