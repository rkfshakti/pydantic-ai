"""The invariants every simulated session is checked against.

Each check reports a violation with a stable `code` and some context, which is what known findings are
matched on (see `_findings.py`). A violation that matches a known finding is recorded and tolerated
(unless `REALTIME_SIMULATION_STRICT` is set, or the simulation was built with `strict=True`); any other
raises `InvariantViolation`, carrying the trace that reproduces it.

The checks are black-box wherever the public API allows: history comes from `all_messages()`, usage
from `session.usage`, and waits are real `wait_for_reply()` calls whose return is judged against the
server's ground truth. The one internal hook is observational: the codec events a connection yields are
recorded on their way into the session, for the lifecycle contract.

Checked after every step:

- `history.mutated`: a message object that appeared in a snapshot changed afterwards;
- `history.removed`: a message disappeared, other than a refused input taken back or the request of a
  send that failed;
- `history.reordered` / `history.inserted`: recorded messages changed order, or a message appeared
  anywhere but the end, other than a tool return placed after its call (every snapshot should be a
  prefix of the next);
- `response.duplicated`: one server response is recorded as two `ModelResponse`s;
- `response.mixed`: one `ModelResponse` holds what two server responses said;
- `wait.early`: a `wait_for_reply()` returned while a reply it was owed was still coming;
- `codec.*`: the connection broke the lifecycle contract (`_conformance.py`);
- `lifecycle.*`: a connection on version 2 of the contract broke a rule its lifecycle events promise
  (`_conformance.py`), checked on its lifecycle stream;
- `api.unexpected_error`: a client call, or iterating the session, raised something other than the
  documented errors;
- `simulator.malformed_frame`: the simulated server sent something the real connection can't parse (a
  bug in the simulator, not the session).

Checked at rest (`settle()`):

- `wait.hang`: a `wait_for_reply()` is still waiting, or a new one doesn't return, with nothing left
  to wait for;
- `history.tool_pairing`: a tool call without exactly one return, a return without its call, or a
  return not directly after its call's response;
- `history.order`: a user input and a response recorded in the opposite order to the one the server
  saw them in, or two responses out of order. History follows the provider's conversation order; with
  history also append-only, a session can only satisfy both by holding a reply back until the user turn
  before it is final, never by inserting the turn afterwards;
- `history.tool_round_order`: something the model said in a response before the first of its tool
  calls' results reached the server is recorded after those results (asynchronous tool calls, where
  the model keeps talking after the call);
- `history.rejected_kept`: an input the provider refused is still in history;
- `response.missing` / `response.truncated`: a response the server completed is missing from history,
  or recorded without all of what it said;
- `usage.total`: `session.usage` tokens differ from what the server billed in the reports the client read;
- `usage.attribution`: a response's recorded usage isn't what the server billed for it;
- `usage.requests`: `usage.requests` differs from the number of responses recorded (or, for a model
  that reports its requests with usage, the number it reported);
- `playback.cut_beyond_audio` / `playback.bad_truncate`: a reply is marked cut past the audio it had,
  or the provider had to refuse a truncation the session sent;
- `wire.duplicate` / `wire.order`: the server got a send twice, or one caller's sends out of order;
- `send.failed_across_reconnect`: a send failed on a dropped connection the session went on to replace;
- `history.roundtrip` / `history.handoff`: history doesn't survive serialization, or a standard
  `Agent.run(message_history=...)` refuses it.

They are the session's and the connection's to fix, not the core's, since the core only sees what the
connection reports:

- `SIM-1`: a reply lost with a dropped connection is not asked for again by the reconnect;
- `SIM-4`, `SIM-23`: the connection drops a whole frame when a request it sends from its receive loop fails,
  or is cancelled by a close, so the core never sees that response's usage or terminal either;
- `SIM-10`: the connection drops what a response said after a cancel that reached the server too late;
- `SIM-15`: a tool that raises leaves the session unable to get the replies still owed after it: the
  connection holds a later request behind the calling response, which the provider never ends;
- `SIM-22`: a terminal read as the connection drops is discarded with it;
- `SIM-24` (accepted): until the server echoes request metadata, the connection infers which response answers
  a request, and can take one server VAD started for it.

class ShadowChecker(Checker):
    """The session invariants, judged on the new core running in shadow of the session.

    History, usage, and waits come from the core instead of the session, so every check says what the core
    would get right or wrong in its place. Its violations are reported as `shadow.<code>`, and only the
    findings in `SHADOW_PENDING` are tolerated: whatever else the session gets wrong, the core must not.
    Its waits mirror the session's: each `wait_for_reply()` the trace starts takes what the core owed at that
    moment, and returns once the core says all of it came.
