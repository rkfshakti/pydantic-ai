"""Fixtures for the Temporal suite. Two things must never be done at module level in this file.

**No requirement gate.** Unlike the test modules and `_shared` beside it, this file carries no
`pytest.skip(..., allow_module_level=True)`, and has to stay importable without `temporalio`,
`logfire`, `mcp` or `openai` and on Python 3.14. `pytest.skip` raises `Skipped`, a `BaseException`;
pytest loads the conftest of every command-line argument's directory up front, from
`PytestPluginManager._set_initial_conftests`, and `_importconftest` catches only `Exception` — so a
gate here escapes as a traceback with exit 1 on `pytest tests/durable_exec/temporal` rather than
reporting a skip. Naming a parent directory hides it, because the conftest is then imported during
collection, which does handle `Skipped`. The test modules' own gates report the skip, and the
fixtures below run only once those gates have passed, so they import what they need when called.

**Nothing sandbox-sensitive at module level.** `_shared`, `pandas` and the root `tests/conftest.py`
(which loads `vcr`) are imported by the test modules inside their own
`workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through()` blocks. Importing any of them at module level here would
re-enter sandbox territory with no passthrough of its own, and the gate rule above forbids the
`temporalio` import that a passthrough block would need. A fixture body is the sanctioned place —
see `close_cached_httpx_client` — because it runs in the main process at test time, never during the
sandbox's re-import of this module.

This is why the suite does not use `tests/conftest.py`'s `try_import()`, which is the repo's default
for optional dependencies elsewhere: importing it would drag `vcr` in at module level.
