        every navigation in the suite would issue a live DNS query. The stub answers
        with a public address, which is the case that changes nothing: a lookup that
        does not answer is a refusal, so returning nothing here would block every
        navigation in the suite. The lookup is stubbed rather than the caching
        wrapper around it, so the cache still runs in every test and the tests that
        care about it can count lookups. The cache is module-level, so it is emptied
        between tests.
