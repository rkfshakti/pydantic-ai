"""A recording stand-in for `DurableContext`.

The real `DurableContext` talks to the durable-execution service, so tests drive a fake that
reproduces the two behaviours this capability depends on:

- a step result is checkpointed through the SDK's serializer, so a value that cannot be
  serialized fails here exactly as it would in production;
- a resumed execution serves a completed step from its checkpoint without running the body
  again, and a step whose body raised is recorded as failed.
