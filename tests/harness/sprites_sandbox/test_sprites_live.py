"""Integration tests that require a real Fly.io Sprite.

The fake-backed suites cover the harness-owned logic: deadline handling, cancellation, and
exception mapping. This live tier admits only what a correctly written fake could not catch: real
process execution in a Sprite, `env` layered on the Sprite's environment, output reaching the
client before a command ends, a closed exec connection stopping a timed-out command, and deletion
as the Sprites control plane reports it.

Admission rule:
  A test belongs here only when its docstring can name the fake-encoded assumption it
  validates against real Sprites behavior.

Gating:
  * `sprites_live` marker separates this tier from fake-backed tests.
  * skipped unless `PYDANTIC_AI_HARNESS_SPRITES_LIVE=1` opts in explicitly.
  * also requires a non-empty `SPRITE_TOKEN`; CI sets `SPRITES_REQUIRE_LIVE`, so there a
    missing token fails instead of skipping.
  * a module-scoped `anyio_backend` fixture keeps the shared Sprites client on one asyncio loop.

Run locally:
`PYDANTIC_AI_HARNESS_SPRITES_LIVE=1 uv run pytest -m sprites_live tests/sprites_sandbox/test_sprites_live.py`
