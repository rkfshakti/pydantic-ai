"""What two of a harness capability on one agent mean.

Every capability this package ships is listed in `COMBINE_POLICY`, and
`test_every_capability_declares_a_combine_policy` fails when one is missing. Adding a capability is
therefore a decision about what two of it mean, taken once, here.

The three answers, and what picks between them:

- `Combines` -- the class declares a default `id`, so two are one configuration stated twice and
  Pydantic AI merges them field by field. This is what lets two packaged harnesses that each carry
  a `ToolOutputLimits` compose instead of colliding.
- `Anonymous` -- no default `id`, and two really do coexist.
- `Collides` -- no default `id`, and two never coexist anyway, because the toolset registers fixed
  tool names. A fact rather than a preference, and pinned by
  `test_two_of_a_colliding_capability_still_raise` so it cannot drift back into an `Anonymous`
  reason describing a configuration ("one per rooted directory") that is unreachable.

Declaring a default `id` is the whole policy: there is no `combine` to write unless the merge needs
something the field-by-field default cannot express, such as a budget that should take the *smaller*
value.

The core half of this lives in `pydantic-ai`'s `tests/test_capability_combine.py`.

Two of the names imported below are private to pydantic-ai, which is right: the duplicate-resolution
pipeline is internal and no code in this package needs it. This file reaches in anyway rather than
reimplementing the two questions the resolver asks -- a lookalike would drift from the real answer
silently, which is the one thing the policy table exists to prevent. Both packages change in the
same pull request, so a rename fails this file alongside the change that made it.
