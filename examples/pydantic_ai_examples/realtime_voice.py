"""A minimal voice assistant built on a realtime speech-to-speech model.

This opens a realtime session with OpenAI's `gpt-realtime` model, streams your microphone
audio to it, and plays the model's spoken replies back through your speakers. The agent
exposes a single `get_weather` tool the model can call mid-conversation.

Talk to it — and try interrupting while it's speaking: the model stops and listens (barge-in).

It needs the `listentome` package for microphone and speaker access
(`pip install listentome`), which requires the PortAudio system library
(`brew install portaudio` on macOS, `apt install libportaudio2` on Debian/Ubuntu),
and an OpenAI API key set via `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Run with:

    uv run -m pydantic_ai_examples.realtime_voice
