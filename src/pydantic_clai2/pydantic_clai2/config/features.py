"""The features this CLAI build supports, by name, so settings saved by another build can say what they need.

Every CLAI on a machine shares one settings database, whatever code it runs: other worktrees,
branches, and installs. A plugin setting whose valid values or meaning depend on code another
build may lack is tagged with a feature name when it is saved (see `PLUGINS.md`). A build that
does not list that name here ignores the setting and uses the default instead.

Names are descriptive, stable, lowercase words joined by hyphens, such as
`stock-bound-delegation`. Never reuse or rename one: other builds compare them as plain strings.
