"""Contain a plugin capability that rejects its own configuration while a run is set up.

A setting the reader cannot honour, saved by another CLAI build, should cost that capability,
not every turn. `PluginGuard` turns a `UserError` raised while the run is being built into
`CapabilitySetupError`, which names the plugin. That turn still fails closed: nothing is retried,
so no other capability is set up twice. The loader then leaves the capability out of later turns.

Only setup is guarded: `for_run`, and `wrap_run` until it hands over to the rest of the run.
Anything raised once the run is under way, by the model, a tool, or a hook, propagates as is.
