"""UI interaction telemetry: shared UI helpers say what the user did, and a subscribed Logfire instance exports it.

Nothing is recorded until a sink subscribes. The built-in `observability` plugin subscribes its own instance when
its `ui_events` setting is on, and unsubscribes before it shuts that instance down. Every span and log is
tagged `clai2-ui`.

Instrument the shared chokepoints (`run_worker`, `Commands.execute_async`, `FieldMenu`, the plugin loader,
`/keys`, the prompt editor) rather than individual menus, so a new menu is covered without extra code.
Attributes name what was chosen (a command, a menu, a setting, a plugin, a key's name), never what was typed:
prompt text, secrets, and free-text values stay out.
