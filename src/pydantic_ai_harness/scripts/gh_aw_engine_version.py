"""Validate `gh-aw/pydantic.md` and print the `pydantic-ai-harness` version its engine pins.

GitHub Agentic Workflows resolves the imported definition at compile time and vendors its
frontmatter into the workflow it generates, so those fields are a published contract rather
than repo-local config: `engine.id` keys the entry in gh-aw's engine catalog, and
`engine.version` is the release the generated workflow installs from PyPI at run time. A
renamed field breaks the catalog entry, and a version that was never published breaks every
run of it at install time.

Consumers import the file from `main`, so a merge reaches them on their next compile and
nothing downstream re-checks it. `--published` is therefore part of the pull request gate
rather than a release step: it asks PyPI the one question the file cannot answer about
itself.

The lint job and the release reminder job both call this, which is why the checks live here
rather than inlined as shell twice.

Inline dependency metadata, so `uv run --script src/pydantic_ai_harness/scripts/gh_aw_engine_version.py` works
without a project sync: neither caller needs any other part of the harness.
