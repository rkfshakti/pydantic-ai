"""Hand-run smoke test for the Playwright browser capability.

Not collected by pytest and not wired into CI: it launches a real Chromium and
reaches the public internet, which the mocked unit suite deliberately avoids. Run
it after installing the browser binary to verify the real integration end to end:

    playwright install chromium
    uv run python scripts/playwright_smoke.py

It exercises the public `PlaywrightBrowser` surface and checks twelve things:

- lazy launch plus a real navigation to https://example.com (prints the title),
- the allowlist bounce (a disallowed host returns an error result, not content),
- the private-address block against a real local server, including the decimal
  spelling of an IP (which only Chromium's canonicalization resolves) and an
  in-page `fetch`, each with an opt-out control proving the server is reachable,
- the private-name block: a hostname resolving to loopback through a public
  wildcard DNS service is refused, which needs real DNS and so cannot be checked
  by the mocked suite,
- a `storage_state` round-trip: a cookie captured from a real context is visible
  to the agent after relaunching the capability with that state,
- embedded content: text inside a real cross-origin iframe reaches the model, a
  `snapshot` ref from that frame clicks inside it, and `wait_for` matches content
  that appears there,
- the browser event log: console output and a failed request land in
  `console_messages` / `network_requests` (a refused request is checked in the
  private-address scenario, where the guard is what refuses it),
- the WebSocket guard: a socket to a loopback port is refused and recorded, while
  a public socket still connects, sends and receives through it,
- tabs: a `target="_blank"` link opens a second tab that stays open, `tabs` lists
  it, selects it, reads it, and closes it,
- dialogs: a real `confirm` is dismissed by default and accepted after
  `handle_next_dialog`, and a `prompt` is answered with the given text,
- keystroke-level typing and a disappearance wait: a type-ahead handler that
  `fill` never triggers fires under `sequential=True`, and `wait_for(gone=True)`
  returns once a spinner is hidden,
- attaching over `cdp_url` to a browser that already holds a session: the run gets
  its own context (the existing cookie is not visible), the allowlist still bounces,
  and the host browser's own page survives teardown,
- clean teardown: each scenario runs its own capability, whose `wrap_run` closes
  the browser when the run ends. After it prints `all checks passed`, confirm no
  Chromium lingered, e.g. `pgrep -fl chromium` shows nothing this script started.
