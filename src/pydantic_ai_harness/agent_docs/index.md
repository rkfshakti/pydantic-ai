# Harness Agent Docs

Use these guides when building or reviewing `pydantic-ai-harness` changes.

## Required Reads

For any code change:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. This file
3. The guide below that matches the task
4. The public Pydantic AI docs for the integration points you touch

## Task Routing

- New or changed capability API: `capability-authoring.md`
- Working on (or refreshing) a capability that wraps an external service, image,
  or CLI: `capability-authoring.md` "External-Service Assumptions And Refresh"
- New or changed tests: `testing-capabilities.md`
- Spawning tasks or subprocesses, task groups or cancel scopes, locks, events,
  streams, async context managers or generators, thread or event-loop
  boundaries, or testing any of those: `concurrency.md`
- Unsure whether behavior belongs in harness or Pydantic AI core: `core-boundary.md`
- Adding a retry, fallback or error-handling field to a capability that takes a
  pluggable dependency: `capability-authoring.md` "Policy Lives In The Pluggable
  Component"
- Deciding what a capability emits to OpenTelemetry, or documenting that it
  emits nothing: `capability-authoring.md` "Telemetry"
- README, `docs/` pages, or capability READMEs: `docs-conventions.md`
- Review, pre-PR check, or final self-check: `review-checklist.md`
- Commands/parsers, processes/containers, network endpoints, resource cleanup,
  output limits, or CI trust boundaries: `review-checklist.md` "Executable
  Boundaries" before implementation and review
- Adding a link to an open issue in a docs page, a README, or source:
  `review-checklist.md` "Issue References"

## Exemplar

Use `pydantic_ai_harness.code_mode` as the current exemplar for capability
shape:

- public re-export from `pydantic_ai_harness/__init__.py`
- package-level re-export from `pydantic_ai_harness/code_mode/__init__.py`
- public capability class in `_capability.py`
- implementation toolset in `_toolset.py`
- capability README next to implementation
- mirrored tests under `tests/code_mode/`

Do not copy `CodeMode` mechanically. Use it to understand package shape,
testing depth, docs placement, and how a harness capability composes with
Pydantic AI toolsets.
