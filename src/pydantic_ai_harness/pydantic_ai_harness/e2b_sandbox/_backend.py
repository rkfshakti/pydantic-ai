"""An E2B sandbox behind Pydantic AI's `WorkspaceBackend` protocol.

SDK assumptions verified 2026-09-09 against E2B 2.46.4 and 2.34.0: `connect` resumes
paused workspaces, with a 300-second lifetime unless it is given `timeout`; commands use
`/bin/bash -l -c`, the SDK command timeout does not kill the process, and command handles
accumulate output. `create(lifecycle=...)` exists from 2.48.0, the package floor. Re-check
https://github.com/e2b-dev/E2B/blob/main/packages/python-sdk/e2b/sandbox_async/main.py and
https://github.com/e2b-dev/E2B/blob/main/packages/python-sdk/e2b/sandbox_async/commands/command.py
before changing acquisition or deadline behavior.

Exception types verified 2026-09-25 against E2B 2.51.0
(https://github.com/e2b-dev/E2B/blob/main/packages/python-sdk/e2b/exceptions.py): a missing key or
a 401 is `AuthenticationException`; a gone sandbox is `SandboxNotFoundException` from the control
plane and a `TimeoutException` from envd (its proxy's 502); a 429 is `RateLimitException`, a
`SandboxException` subclass; a create the API refuses is a `SandboxException` carrying its 4xx
`status_code`; a 503 is `ServiceBusyException` (new in 2.48.0, hence the floor),
which is not. envd types only a missing path; its other path failures arrive as a 400
(`InvalidArgumentException`) or a 500 (`SandboxException`) whose message carries envd's wording
or Go's errno text, which `_path_error` reads.

    """An [E2B](https://e2b.dev) sandbox as a Pydantic AI [`WorkspaceBackend`][pydantic_ai.workspaces.WorkspaceBackend].

    Commands and file operations run inside an E2B microVM, so the host is never exposed.

    Building one does no I/O. The first operation creates or attaches to a workspace, and the
    typed `e2b.AsyncSandbox` is available through `get_sandbox()`. The backend does not kill the
    sandbox; killing it is the application's job.

    Commands run as one-shot operations, with complete output returned after they finish.

    Every command runs through `/bin/bash -l -c`, so an argv sequence is quoted into a single
    shell word string first and login startup files run before the command does; a
    `shell=True` string runs under `/bin/sh -c` inside that login shell. E2B's own
    command `timeout` abandons the output stream and leaves the command running, so the
    deadline is enforced client-side instead. On timeout or cancellation (including while
    starting), a separate command signals the process group when `setsid` is available.
    Custom templates without `setsid` fall back to stopping the command leader only.

    Args:
        sandbox: A live `e2b.AsyncSandbox` you already have. Whoever created it owns killing it.
        ref: Identity of an existing sandbox to attach to on first use.
        template: E2B template name or ID a newly created sandbox runs; E2B's default when `None`.
            An unknown template raises `WorkspaceUnavailableError` on first use. Custom templates
            need `/bin/bash` and `/bin/sh`; without `setsid`, stop targets only the leader.
        allow_internet_access: Whether a newly created sandbox may reach the internet.
        sandbox_timeout: Total lifetime of the sandbox in seconds, applied when it is created and
            again when attaching to it. When it runs out, E2B pauses the sandbox rather than
            killing it, and attaching resumes it. The default, 3600, is the most E2B's Hobby plan
            allows; Pro plans allow up to 86400.
        working_dir: Absolute directory commands start in and relative paths resolve against.
            E2B has no create-time working directory, so this is applied per command, including
            on an attached sandbox; `None` uses the sandbox's own default, discovered with
            `pwd -P` on first use.
        env: Environment variables every command gets, on a created or an attached sandbox;
            per-command `env` is layered on top. Nothing is read from the host environment.
