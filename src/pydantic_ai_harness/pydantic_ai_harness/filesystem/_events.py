"""Events emitted by the filesystem capability.

Each event carries two path fields:

- `path`: normalized and relative to the emitting filesystem's root, never an
  absolute path, so it is safe to echo to the model or a UI. A file reached
  through a symlink keeps the name it was reached by.
- `root_dir`: the root the `path` is relative to, as an absolute POSIX path
  inside the run's workspace with its symlinks resolved, so a subscriber can
  locate the file (`posixpath.join(root_dir, path)`) in that workspace without
  assuming it shares the emitter's root.

A diff in an event is a unified diff cut at `MAX_EVENT_DIFF_CHARS` with a
`truncated` flag, so an event stream that is persisted or forwarded to a UI
cannot be flooded by one large write. A change whose text is longer than
`MAX_DIFF_SOURCE_CHARS` on either side is not diffed at all.
