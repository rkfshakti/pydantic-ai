# Subagents

Let an agent delegate self-contained tasks to named child agents.

[Source](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/tree/main/src/pydantic_ai_harness/pydantic_ai_harness/subagents/)

## The problem

A single agent that does everything accumulates a large tool set and a long context. Splitting the work across specialized sub-agents keeps each context focused, but wiring up delegation by hand means writing a tool per agent, forwarding deps, threading usage limits, and telling the model what it can delegate to.

## The solution

`SubAgents` takes a sequence of `SubAgent` entries and exposes a single `delegate_task(agent_name, task)` tool. Each delegation runs the chosen sub-agent in its own run -- with its own message history, so it never sees the parent conversation -- and returns its output to the parent. The available sub-agents are listed in the system prompt as a static instruction, so the listing stays in the cached prefix.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import SubAgent, SubAgents

researcher = Agent('anthropic:claude-opus-5-5', name='researcher', description='Researches a topic and reports findings')
writer = Agent('anthropic:claude-opus-5-5', name='writer', description='Turns notes into polished prose')

orchestrator = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-opus-5-5',
    capabilities=[SubAgents(agents=[SubAgent(researcher), SubAgent(writer)])],
)

result = orchestrator.run_sync('Research the history of TLS and write a one-paragraph summary.')
print(result.output)
```

A delegate's name -- how the parent model refers to it, and how it is listed in the prompt -- is the agent's own `name`, or a `SubAgent(name=...)` override. Two delegates resolving to the same name is an error, and an agent with no name and no override is rejected.

## The tool

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `delegate_task(agent_name, task)` | Run the named sub-agent on a self-contained task and return its output. |

- The sub-agent runs with its own message history, so `task` must be self-contained.
- An unknown `agent_name` raises `ModelRetry`, so the model can correct itself.
- The result returned to the parent is `str(result.output)`.
- With a `models` menu configured, the tool takes an extra `model` argument (see below).

## Deps, usage, tools, and capabilities

- **Deps are forwarded.** The parent run's `deps` are passed to each sub-agent, so sub-agents share the parent's `AgentDepsT` (enforced by the type signature -- every sub-agent is an `AbstractAgent[AgentDepsT, Any]`).
- Delegated agents run in the parent's workspace, including wrappers such as `ReadOnlyWorkspace`.
- **Usage is shared by default.** The parent's `usage` is passed to each sub-agent run, so token usage aggregates and a parent `usage_limits` applies across the whole agent tree. Set `forward_usage=False` to give each sub-agent run its own accounting.
- **Tools can be inherited.** With `inherit_tools=True`, the parent agent's own tools (registered directly or via `toolsets`) are added to each sub-agent run, on top of the sub-agent's own. Tools contributed by the parent's capabilities are not inherited: they are bound to capability instances registered in the parent run, and would arrive without the hooks and instructions they depend on. Use `shared_capabilities` to give sub-agents a capability. This also excludes the delegate tool itself, so a sub-agent can't recurse into further delegation. Off by default.
- **Capabilities can be shared.** `shared_capabilities` are applied to every sub-agent run -- e.g. give all sub-agents a common guardrail, memory, or planning capability without rebuilding each `Agent`.
- **Sub-agent events can be streamed.** Pass an `event_stream_handler` and it's forwarded to each sub-agent run, so the sub-agent's model-streaming and tool events surface to the caller (the handler receives the sub-agent's own `RunContext`).

## Delegating to the agent itself

With `include_self=True`, the roster also lists the running agent itself, as `self`. A delegation to `self` starts a fresh run of that agent (`RunContext.agent`) on the parent run's model (or the `models` option the parent picks), with no parent conversation. Because the child is the same `Agent`, it has every capability, toolset, and instruction bound to it, and they register again in the child run: a guardrail, approval gate, or audit hook bound next to `SubAgents` sees the tool calls the delegate makes, not only the `delegate_task` call. This is what [`Coder`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/coder/) uses by default.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import SubAgents

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-opus-4-7',
    capabilities=[SubAgents(include_self=True, agent_folders=None)],
)
```

- **Only what is bound to the `Agent` carries over.** Capabilities, toolsets, instructions, and model settings passed to the parent's `run()` are not part of the agent, so the delegate does not get them. Passing `SubAgents(include_self=True)` itself to `run()` raises a `UserError` when the run starts, since the delegate would come up without it.
- **Delegation depth is capped.** The delegate carries `delegate_task` too, so `max_depth` (default `3`, counting the top-level run) bounds the tree: the top-level run delegates, its delegates delegate once more, and a run at the limit gets neither `delegate_task` nor the sub-agent listing. The limit applies to every delegation through `SubAgents`, including explicit rosters.
- **Delegates inherit everything, including what may not suit a sub-task.** An `AskUser` capability bound to the agent can prompt the user from inside a delegation, and the delegate returns the agent's own `output_type`, rendered with `str()`.
- `inherit_tools` does not apply to `self`, whose tools are already the parent's. The name `self` is reserved: an explicit delegate with that name is an error, and a disk definition with that name is skipped with a warning.

## Per-delegate run controls

Each `SubAgent` carries its own budgets, so one delegate's controls do not touch the others. A `SubAgent` with no controls set runs with the `SubAgents` defaults.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.usage import UsageLimits
from pydantic_ai_harness import SubAgent, SubAgents

reproducer = Agent('anthropic:claude-opus-5-5', instructions='Reproduce the reported bug from a minimal script.')
librarian = Agent('anthropic:claude-opus-5-5', instructions='Find relevant docs, issues, and prior art.')

orchestrator = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-opus-5-5',
    capabilities=[
        SubAgents(
            agents=[
                SubAgent(reproducer, usage_limits=UsageLimits(request_limit=35), timeout_seconds=600, max_calls=1),
                SubAgent(librarian, usage_limits=UsageLimits(request_limit=18), timeout_seconds=300, max_calls=2),
            ]
        )
    ],
)
```

| Field | Effect |
|---|---|
| `models` | Which keys of the `SubAgents` model menu this delegate may run on, and which one it runs on by default: the first key listed. See "Per-delegation model selection" below. |
| `usage_limits` | A request/token budget for one delegation. The child runs with its own usage accounting, so the budget counts only that child's requests and tokens (not the parent's or siblings'), even when `forward_usage=True`. The tradeoff: that child's tokens no longer aggregate into the parent's `usage`. Reaching the budget is a soft outcome (see below), not a run-stopping `UsageLimitExceeded`. |
| `timeout_seconds` | A wall-clock budget for one delegation. When the child exceeds it, its run is cancelled and the parent gets a soft steering message instead of hanging on the child. The cancelled child's `event_stream_handler` (if any) stops receiving events without a terminal event. |
| `max_calls` | The maximum number of delegations to this sub-agent per parent run. Once reached, further delegations return a soft budget-exhausted message without running the child. Counts are scoped to one `Agent.run` (a `run_id`) and cleared when it ends, so each parent run and each level of a nested tree budgets independently. |
| `on_failure` | A steering message returned to the parent for any soft degradation of this delegate, in place of the built-in default. Setting it also makes child failures soft (see below). |
| `contain_errors` | Whether an unexpected crash in this delegate is caught and returned to the parent as a bounded `ModelRetry` instead of aborting the parent run (see below). Unset inherits the `SubAgents(contain_errors=...)` default (off). |

## Per-delegation model selection

The orchestrator knows how hard a task is at the moment it writes the brief, so it is the right place to decide which model runs it. Configure a `models` menu and the delegate tool gains a `model` argument that names one of its keys.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.settings import ModelSettings
from pydantic_ai_harness import SubAgent, SubAgents
from pydantic_ai_harness.subagents import ModelOption

reviewer = Agent('anthropic:claude-opus-5-5', name='reviewer', description='Reviews a diff')
linter = Agent('anthropic:claude-opus-5-5', name='linter', description='Runs the linter and reports failures')

orchestrator = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-opus-5-5',
    capabilities=[
        SubAgents(
            agents=[SubAgent(reviewer), SubAgent(linter, models=['fast'])],
            models={
                'fast': 'anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5',
                'standard': 'anthropic:claude-sonnet-5',
                'deep': ModelOption(
                    'anthropic:claude-opus-5-5',
                    description='hard reasoning, multi-file changes',
                    settings=ModelSettings(thinking='xhigh'),
                ),
            },
        )
    ],
)
```

- **Off by default.** With no `models` menu the `model` argument is not in the tool schema at all, and every delegation runs exactly as it did before.
- **The keys are the interface.** They are listed in the system prompt with each entry's model and description, and the tool schema offers them as an enum, so the model picks from the menu instead of inventing a model name. Name them for the job (`'fast'`, `'deep'`), not for the vendor.
- **An entry is a model or a `ModelOption`.** `ModelOption(model, description=..., settings=...)` adds a routing hint and per-option `ModelSettings`, so one key can mean "same model, more thinking". Those settings merge over the sub-agent's own `model_settings`, which keeps the parts the option does not set.
- **Resolution order.** The key the parent passed, else the delegate's first allowed key (see below), else the delegate's own model, else the parent run's model.
- **A delegate can be restricted.** `SubAgent(linter, models=['fast'])` pins that delegate to `fast`: the first listed key is what it runs on when the parent passes no `model`, and the others are refused with a `ModelRetry`. The restriction is rendered in the prompt listing (`- linter: Runs the linter (models: fast)`). Restricting to a key the menu does not define is a `ValueError` at construction.
- **A rejected key costs nothing.** An unknown or unavailable key comes back as a `ModelRetry` listing the valid options, before the delegate's `max_calls` budget is charged.

## Failure handling

A *soft outcome* returns a steering message to the parent as a normal tool result, so its model reads the message and decides what to do next (rather than immediately re-delegating, which a `ModelRetry` invites). A timeout, a reached `usage_limits` budget, and an exhausted `max_calls` budget are always soft. When `on_failure` is set, the message it carries replaces the built-in default for these outcomes.

A sub-agent run that fails with a *soft model error* (`ModelRetry`, `UnexpectedModelBehavior`, e.g. it exhausted its own retries) is, by default, converted into a `ModelRetry` for the parent -- so the parent's model sees `Sub-agent '<name>' failed: ...` and can react by re-delegating. The delegate tool defaults to `tool_retries=2`, so the parent aborts only after that many consecutive delegate failures; the counter resets after any successful delegation. Raise `tool_retries` to tolerate a flakier sub-agent, or set `None` to inherit the parent agent's default tool retries. Set `on_failure` for a delegate to make its failures soft instead: the child error returns the `on_failure` message as a normal tool result.

Hard errors propagate to stop the whole run. A `UsageLimitExceeded` from a child that has *no* per-delegate `usage_limits` (so it shares the parent's accounting) means the whole tree is out of budget and propagates; a child reaching its *own* `usage_limits` is soft, as above.

An *unexpected crash* -- any other exception the child raises, such as a provider `ModelAPIError`/`FallbackExceptionGroup` or a plain `ValueError` from a bad tool argument -- propagates by default and aborts the parent run. Set `contain_errors=True` (per delegate, or as the `SubAgents` default) to catch it and return it to the parent as a bounded `ModelRetry` instead, so one delegate crash cannot kill the whole run. Containment stays loud: the exception rides the retry message (`Sub-agent '<name>' crashed: ...`), it is logged via the standard `logging` module, and `tool_retries` still bounds consecutive crashes into an abort. This is orthogonal to `on_failure` -- a contained crash always raises the loud retry, never the soft `on_failure` return, so a genuine bug is never masked as success. Cancellation, a shared `UsageLimitExceeded`, pydantic-ai control-flow signals (`CallDeferred`, `ApprovalRequired`, the `Skip*` signals), and `UserError` bypass containment regardless of `contain_errors`. Cancellation covers both kinds: external cancellation (`asyncio.CancelledError`) propagates as-is, and a child's own first-party cancellation (`RunContext.cancel()` inside the child, raising `RunCancelled`) leaves the delegate tool uncontained, after which pydantic-ai isolates it as a failed `delegate_task` return the parent model can react to, not a crash retry that invites re-delegation.

## Events

`SubAgents` emits typed capability events in the `sub_agents` namespace so a host can show a delegation as it runs, and how it ended, without parsing the delegate tool's arguments and result:

| Event | Dispatch | When | Payload |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DelegationStartEvent` | stream | a delegation passed every check and the child run is about to start | `agent_name`, `task`, `truncated`, `model` (the menu key, or `None`), `inherits_tools` |
| `DelegationEndEvent` | stream | the delegation settled into what the parent receives | `agent_name`, `outcome`, `output`, `truncated`, `usage`, `duration_seconds` |

Both are notifications. One delegation is one `delegate_task` call, so a start and its end share the `tool_call_id` core stamps on every event; that is how a subscriber pairs them when the model delegates in parallel.

`outcome` follows the failure handling above: `ok` (the child's output went back to the parent), `timeout`, `budget` (the child's own `usage_limits`), `failed` (a soft model error, returned as `on_failure` or raised as a `ModelRetry`), or `contained` (a crash `contain_errors` caught). `output` is what the delegate tool hands back to the parent in each case: the child's output, the steering message, or the retry text. It is emitted from inside the tool, before any `ToolGuardrail` result guard screens that text for the model; a host that needs the screened version reads the `ToolReturnPart` in core's `FunctionToolResultEvent`. `usage` is the child's own `RunUsage` when it has separate accounting (`usage_limits` set, or `forward_usage=False`) and `None` when it accrues into the parent's usage, where its share is not separable.

A delegation refused before the child runs (an unknown sub-agent, a model key off the menu, an exhausted `max_calls` budget) emits nothing; the tool result says why. An exception that propagates out of the delegate tool (a shared usage limit, an uncontained crash, a cancellation) ends without an end event. A `SubAgentToolset` registered directly in `Agent(toolsets=[...])` has no owning capability and emits nothing. As with any capability event, a listener that raises aborts the parent run.

`task` and `output` are cut at `MAX_EVENT_TEXT_CHARS` (4096) with a `truncated` flag, so a persisted or forwarded event stream cannot be flooded by one verbose delegation.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import AbstractCapability, on_event
from pydantic_ai_harness.subagents import DelegationEndEvent, SubAgent, SubAgents


class ReportDelegations(AbstractCapability):
    @on_event(DelegationEndEvent)
    async def on_delegation_end(self, ctx, event: DelegationEndEvent) -> None:
        print(f'{event.agent_name}: {event.outcome} in {event.duration_seconds:.1f}s')


researcher = Agent('anthropic:claude-opus-5-5', name='researcher')
agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-opus-5-5',
    capabilities=[SubAgents(agents=[SubAgent(researcher)]), ReportDelegations()],
)
```

Nested model streaming from the child run is not an event concern; pass an `event_stream_handler` for that.

`SubAgents` emits no OpenTelemetry spans of its own: the child run is a core agent run with its own spans nested under the parent's tool-call span, and the events above carry the outcome a trace would only show as an exception or a tool result.

## Discovery

The sub-agents are listed in the system prompt via `get_instructions`, using each agent's `description` (or a `SubAgent(description=...)` override). A sub-agent with no description is listed by name alone.

## Loading sub-agents from disk

A repo's markdown agent definitions become delegates without writing any `Agent` code. By default every `*.md` file under the conventional folders is loaded as a sub-agent, alongside the explicitly-passed `agents`.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import SubAgents

orchestrator = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-opus-5-5',
    capabilities=[SubAgents(inherit_tools=True)],  # auto-loads .agents/agents/ from the run's workspace
)
```

Definitions are read at the start of every run from the run's [workspace](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/core-concepts/workspace/), so a sandbox's agent files are found and nothing is read from your home directory. To read them from somewhere else, such as definitions that ship with your application, pass `workspace=LocalWorkspaceBackend('/app')`.

`agent_folders` controls which folders are read. It defaults to `'agents'`, the conventional layout:

- A folder-name `str` (the default `'agents'`): load from `.agents/<name>/` under the workspace's working directory, falling back to `.claude/<name>/` when `.agents/` is absent. A run without a workspace skips it.
- A sequence of workspace paths, absolute or relative to the working directory, loads from exactly those folders, in order.
- `None` disables disk loading, exposing only the explicitly-passed `agents`.

Until this release, the folders were read from this machine, including the home folder `~/.agents/agents/`. A run without a workspace now fails at its start when given a path sequence. Convention discovery warns once when it skips a folder in the current or home directory that the workspace does not reach, naming the folder and the `workspace=` that reads it.

### Definition format

A definition is a markdown file with optional frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: researcher
description: Researches a topic and reports findings
tools: Read, Grep
---
You research topics. Report your findings, each with a source.
```

- `name` is the delegate name (how the parent refers to it and how it is listed). It falls back to the filename stem when absent.
- `description` drives the prompt listing.
- The markdown body becomes the agent's instructions.
- `tools` (or `allowed-tools`) is a comma-separated string or a YAML block list. See "Tools" below.
- `model` and `color` are ignored: the model is inherited from the parent (see below), and `color` has no pyai equivalent.

Frontmatter is read by a small, dependency-free parser limited to those keys (`pyyaml` is not a harness dependency). Full YAML frontmatter is not supported.

### Models and effort

Disk agents inherit the parent run's model by default. Per agent, the caller can override the model and set a thinking/effort level via `agent_overrides`, keyed by the agent's name:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness import SubAgents
from pydantic_ai_harness.subagents import AgentOverride

SubAgents(
    agent_folders='agents',
    agent_overrides={'researcher': AgentOverride(model='anthropic:claude-opus-5-5', effort='high')},
)
```

Every agent the capability builds runs at a minimum thinking-effort floor. `MINIMUM_EFFORT_FLOOR` and the `clamp_effort(level, floor=...)` helper are exported so an orchestrator can apply the same floor to its own agents (that orchestrator-side application is the caller's responsibility). `clamp_effort` maps `None`/`False` to the floor, leaves `True` (provider-default effort) unchanged, and raises a concrete level below the floor up to it. Effort is applied through pyai's `ModelSettings.thinking`.

### Tools

A disk agent gets no tools by default (`inherit_tools` is `False`); set `inherit_tools=True` to expose the parent's tools to it through the `inherit_tools` mechanism, in which case its `tools` frontmatter is ignored. To map the frontmatter tool names to specific toolsets instead, pass a `tool_resolver`: it receives each tool name (so it can honor entries like `Bash(git:*)`) and returns the toolsets that provide it, or `None` for an unknown name, which is skipped with a warning.

```python {names="defined"}
from collections.abc import Sequence

from pydantic_ai.toolsets import AgentToolset
from pydantic_ai_harness import SubAgents

TOOLSETS: dict[str, Sequence[AgentToolset[object]]] = {}  # your tool name -> toolsets mapping


def resolve(tool_name: str) -> Sequence[AgentToolset[object]] | None:
    return TOOLSETS.get(tool_name)

SubAgents(agent_folders='agents', tool_resolver=resolve)
```

### Precedence

When the same name appears in more than one source, the higher-precedence one wins and the others are skipped with a warning: explicitly-passed `agents` first, then earlier folders before later ones. A duplicate name within the explicitly-passed `agents` list is still an error.

## Configuration

```python {names="defined"}
from pydantic_ai_harness import SubAgents

SubAgents(
    agents=(),             # Sequence[SubAgent[AgentDepsT]] -- each pairs an agent with its run controls
    models={},             # Mapping[str, Model | str | ModelOption] -- per-delegation model menu (off when empty)
    agent_folders='agents',# folder-name str (convention) | Sequence[str | Path] workspace paths | None (disable)
    agent_overrides={},    # Mapping[str, AgentOverride] -- per-disk-agent model/effort override
    tool_resolver=None,    # Callable[[str], Sequence[AgentToolset[object]] | None] -- disk-agent tool mapping
    forward_usage=True,    # share the parent's usage with sub-agent runs
    inherit_tools=False,   # expose the parent's own tools to sub-agents (capability tools excluded)
    shared_capabilities=(),# capabilities applied to every sub-agent run
    event_stream_handler=None,  # forwarded to each sub-agent run to stream its events
    tool_name='delegate_task',
    tool_retries=2,        # extra delegate-tool attempts after a sub-agent error before aborting (None inherits the agent default)
    contain_errors=False,  # default for SubAgent.contain_errors: contain an unexpected crash as a bounded retry
    workspace=None,        # WorkspaceBackend to read agent_folders from instead of the run's workspace
    include_self=False,    # also list the running agent itself as the delegate `self`
    max_depth=3,           # delegation levels, counting the top-level run
)
```

```python {names="defined"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import SubAgent

agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-opus-5-5')

SubAgent(
    agent,                 # AbstractAgent[AgentDepsT, Any] -- the child agent to run
    name=None,             # delegate name; defaults to the agent's own `name`
    description=None,      # prompt-listing description; defaults to the agent's own `description`
    models=None,           # Sequence[str] -- menu keys this delegate may run on; the first is its default
    usage_limits=None,     # per-delegation request/token budget (isolated accounting)
    timeout_seconds=None,  # per-delegation wall-clock budget
    max_calls=None,        # max delegations to this sub-agent per parent run
    on_failure=None,       # steering message for soft degradations of this delegate
    contain_errors=None,   # contain an unexpected crash as a bounded retry; None inherits the SubAgents default
)
```

`SubAgents` is not serializable via the agent spec (it holds live `Agent` instances), so `get_serialization_name()` returns `None`.

## Notes

- Sub-agents can themselves have `SubAgents`, forming a tree. Each `SubAgents` stops offering delegation once the run is at its own `max_depth`, so a delegate with a higher limit can go deeper than its parent's. Share `usage` (the default) and set a `usage_limits` on the top-level run to bound the whole tree.
- Delegations the model issues in parallel run as independent sub-agent runs.
