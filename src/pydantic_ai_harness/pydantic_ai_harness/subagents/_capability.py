"""


@dataclass
class SubAgents(AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]):
    """Let an agent delegate self-contained tasks to named sub-agents.

    Exposes a single `delegate_task(agent_name, task)` tool. Each delegation
    runs the chosen sub-agent in a fresh, isolated run (it never sees the parent
    conversation), and the available sub-agents are listed in the system prompt
    as a static, cache-stable instruction.

    Sub-agents are passed as a sequence of `SubAgent` entries, each pairing an
    agent with its per-delegate run controls (a `usage_limits` budget, a
    wall-clock `timeout_seconds`, a per-run `max_calls` budget, an `on_failure`
    steering message, and optional `name`/`description` overrides). A delegate's
    name is its `SubAgent.name`, or the agent's own `name` when unset; two
    explicitly-passed delegates resolving to the same name is an error.

    Delegations run on the sub-agent's own model unless a `models` menu is
    configured, in which case `delegate_task` also takes a `model` argument naming
    one of the menu's keys, so the parent routes each task to the model that fits
    it. A `SubAgent` can restrict which keys it accepts (`SubAgent.models`).

    Sub-agents can also be loaded from disk: each Markdown or standalone TOML definition under
    `agent_folders` in the run's workspace becomes a delegate, built with the
    parent's model. Folders are read at the start of every run, through
    `ctx.workspace`, or through `workspace` when set. Disk delegates get no tools
    by default; pass a `tool_resolver` to map their frontmatter tool names.
    Disk delegates coexist with explicitly-passed ones; explicitly-passed agents take
    precedence. Convention folders use `.agents/`, then `.claude/`, then `.codex/`; explicit folder sequences use
    earlier folders before later ones. A disk delegate whose
    name is already taken is skipped with a warning. Configure or disable this with
    `agent_folders`; see also `agent_overrides` and `tool_resolver`.

    Standalone TOML requires Python 3.11+ and nonempty string `name`, `description`,
    and `developer_instructions`. Optional `tools` or `allowed-tools` accepts a list
    of nonempty strings or a comma-separated string, resolved by `tool_resolver`.
    Model/effort/display fields (`model`, `effort`, `model_reasoning_effort`, `color`)
    are ignored with a warning. Other TOML fields cause the file to be skipped,
    including unsupported permission/sandbox settings and legacy `[agents.name]`
    `config_file` declarations. Malformed files warn without blocking valid files.

    With `include_self=True`, the roster also lists the running agent itself, as `self`:
    a delegation starts a fresh run of `RunContext.agent`, so the delegate has every
    capability, tool, and instruction bound to that agent, including guardrails and
    approval hooks added next to this one. Delegations nest at most `max_depth` levels.

    The parent's `deps` are forwarded to each sub-agent (sub-agents therefore
    share the parent's `AgentDepsT`), and by default the parent's `usage` is
    shared so usage limits apply across the whole agent tree. Extra capabilities
    can be applied to every sub-agent run (`shared_capabilities`), and sub-agent
    events can be streamed to a handler (`event_stream_handler`).
