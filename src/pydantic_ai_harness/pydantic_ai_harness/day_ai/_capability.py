"""Day AI hosted MCP capability.

Provider contract, verified 2026-09-24:

- `https://day.ai/api/mcp` is the Streamable HTTP endpoint; there is one host, with no regional variants.
- Authentication is a Day AI OAuth access token, sent as a bearer token. There is no API key: an unauthenticated
  request gets a 401 whose `WWW-Authenticate` header points at the protected-resource metadata, and the
  authorization server at `https://day.ai` supports dynamic client registration with PKCE.
- Using the server needs a paid Day AI Agent tier; the tier's tools and limits apply.
- The server does not mark tools read-only (it advertises MCP protocol `2024-11-05`, which predates tool
  annotations), so there is no `read_only` option.

Sources: https://day.ai/mcp, https://github.com/day-ai/day-ai-sdk, and the endpoint itself
(`https://day.ai/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/api/mcp`, `https://day.ai/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`).
Re-check by fetching both metadata documents and sending an unauthenticated `initialize` POST to the endpoint.
