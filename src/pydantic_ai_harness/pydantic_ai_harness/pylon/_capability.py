"""Pylon hosted MCP capability.

Provider contract, verified 2026-09-24:

- `https://mcp.usepylon.com` is the Streamable HTTP endpoint (stateless, no server-side sessions). There is one
  host; `/mcp` returns 404.
- Authentication is a Pylon OAuth access token, sent as a bearer token. Pylon REST API tokens are not accepted:
  "The Pylon MCP server only supports OAuth authentication. API key authentication is not currently available."
- The server's protected-resource metadata names `https://o.auth.usepylon.com` as its authorization server, which
  supports dynamic client registration, PKCE (S256), and refresh tokens (`offline_access`).
- Only Member and Admin users with the `MCP Access` role can sign in; Viewer and Integration users cannot.
- The server has tools that change issues and accounts. `read_only` keeps only the tools the server marks read-only;
  its annotations could not be inspected without a Pylon account.

Re-check with an unauthenticated `POST https://mcp.usepylon.com` (401 with a `resource_metadata` challenge) and
`GET https://mcp.usepylon.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` and `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`.
