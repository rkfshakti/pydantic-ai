"""Deprecation warning machinery for renamed APIs and changed defaults.

Used by the compatibility shims left behind by the capability naming pass: a renamed
module keeps a shim package at its old path, and a renamed class keeps a module-level
`__getattr__` alias, both emitting `HarnessDeprecationWarning` through these helpers.
`warn_default_changed` covers an option whose default moved, where existing callers keep
working but get different behavior, `warn_argument_ignored` an argument that is still
accepted but no longer does anything, and `warn_argument_renamed` an argument still accepted
under its old name.
