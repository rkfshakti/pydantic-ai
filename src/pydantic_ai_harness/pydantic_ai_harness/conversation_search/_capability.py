    """Search persisted conversation history with a dependency-free BM25 tool.

    This capability persists nothing itself: it reads whatever history a persistence
    capability already stores, through a `HistorySource`. Pair it with
    `StepPersistence` sharing the same store, and the model can recall what
    compaction dropped from the live context as well as anything from past runs in
    the same conversation:

    ```python
    from pydantic_ai import Agent
    from pydantic_ai_harness.compaction import SlidingWindowCompaction
    from pydantic_ai_harness.conversation_search import ConversationSearch, SnapshotHistorySource
    from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import SqliteStepStore, StepPersistence

    store = SqliteStepStore(database='sessions.db')
    agent = Agent(
        'openai:gpt-5',
        capabilities=[
            StepPersistence(store=store),
            ConversationSearch(SnapshotHistorySource(store), scope='conversation'),
            SlidingWindowCompaction(max_messages=40),
        ],
    )


    async def ask(question: str, conversation_id: str) -> str:
        result = await agent.run(question, conversation_id=conversation_id)
        return result.output
    ```

    Search is conversation-scoped by default, so reaching a past run requires both
    runs to share a `conversation_id`. pydantic-ai resolves one per run: an explicit
    `conversation_id=` wins, otherwise the most recent `conversation_id` on
    `message_history` is inherited, otherwise a fresh one is generated. Threading
    `message_history` through follow-up runs keeps them in one conversation; runs
    sharing neither an explicit id nor a history chain are separate.

    `scope` defaulted to `all` in earlier releases and now defaults to `conversation`.
    Upgrading raises nothing -- a store-wide caller keeps working with a narrower corpus
    -- so leaving `scope` unset emits a `HarnessDeprecationWarning` once per instance.
    Pass `scope='all'` to restore the old behavior or `scope='conversation'` to keep the
    new one; both are supported and neither is deprecated.

    Some compaction strategies persist their edits into the run's durable message
    history (`SummarizingCompaction` replaces summarized prefixes for good; a
    `SlidingWindowCompaction` trim only narrows what each request sends). Either way,
    `StepPersistence` snapshots each step boundary before the next compaction runs,
    so the union of a run's snapshots still holds the originals --
    `SnapshotHistorySource` recovers them. No ordering or hook coordination between
    the capabilities is required; the search tool reads the store lazily at call
    time.

    so, rather than falling back to every other unlabelled run. `all` searches every
    run the source enumerates and must only be used when the store is already isolated
    to one principal.

    `None` means the caller did not choose, which resolves to `conversation` and emits a
    `HarnessDeprecationWarning` once per instance: this default was `all` in earlier
    releases, and the change is otherwise silent because a store-wide caller keeps working
    and simply stops seeing other conversations. Set the option explicitly to opt out of
    the warning; both values are supported and neither is deprecated.
