"""History sources: where the search corpus comes from.

The search layer never persists anything itself. It consumes a `HistorySource` --
"enumerate persisted runs, yield each run's durable message record" -- and ships
`SnapshotHistorySource`, an adapter that recovers that record from the snapshots a
`pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence.StepPersistence` capability already writes.

The adapter exists because today's step-persistence substrate stores per-boundary
full-history snapshots, and compaction strategies that persist their edits (e.g.
`SummarizingCompaction`) carry those edits into later snapshots: the latest snapshot
is then post-compaction, but earlier snapshots of the same run still hold the
originals, so reconciling each snapshot's carried-forward prefix against the
accumulated history and excluding compaction artifacts recovers the durable record.
The overlap is reconciled by sequence position, so byte-identical messages at
distinct positions remain in the record. A substrate that keeps an append-only
entry log (the session-tree direction of pydantic-ai-harness#321) can implement
`HistorySource` directly via replay and replace the adapter without touching the
search layer.
