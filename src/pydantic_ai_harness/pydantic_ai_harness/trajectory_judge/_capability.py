    Long-horizon runs drift: instructions fade, unsupported claims compound, and the agent
    wanders off the goal. A `TrajectoryJudge` evaluates the most recent `window` tokens of
    the run's trajectory every `every` model requests, concurrently with the run, and
    delivers exactly one verdict per evaluation: `AllGood`, or `Steer` with a corrective
    message. Steering is enqueued into the run (`RunContext.enqueue`, `'asap'` priority)
    with attribution to the judge, so the running agent course-corrects while recovery is
    still cheap.

    At most one evaluation per judge is in flight at a time; a cadence tick that finds one
    still running is skipped. An evaluation still in flight when the run ends is cancelled.
    The judge's model and tool usage are threaded onto the run's `usage` and respect its
    `usage_limits`: each launch claims one request on the shared usage before the
    evaluation starts, so the parent's next preflight and sibling launches account for the
    in-flight call, and a launch the request budget cannot fit is skipped. An evaluation
    failure is raised on the run at the next cadence tick or at run end; give the judge a
    fallback model (via `agent`) if you need it to degrade instead.

    from pydantic_ai import Agent

    with `UserError` before the first model request: the evaluation is launched from a
