"""Stop the process groups whose command line holds the tag `$1`, leaving out this script's own group.

`sshd` starts each command in a session of its own, so its group is the command's; a detached command
that started a session of its own (the harness `Shell`'s jobs) is in another group and keeps running.
`kill -s SIG --` is the form every POSIX shell's `kill` accepts; dash rejects `kill -TERM -- -<group>`.
The `SIGKILL` for groups that outlast `SIGTERM` comes a second later in the background, with its output
closed so `sshd` doesn't wait for it, so a stop costs one round trip.

It runs on the host, outside any sandbox wrapping this backend, so `ps`, `grep` and the rest come from the
system directories only: the login `PATH` can hold a directory the stopped command could write to, such as
`~/.local/bin` under a working directory that contains the home directory.

    """Run commands on a remote host with the system's OpenSSH `ssh` client.

    Authentication, host keys, ports and jump hosts come from your SSH configuration (`~/.ssh/config`)
    and agent; `ssh` never prompts, so a missing key fails instead of waiting for a password. File
    operations run as shell commands on the host (see [Writing a backend](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/core-concepts/workspace/#writing-a-backend)),
    which needs a POSIX `sh` there.
    The remote directory is the environment: the first operation raises
    [`WorkspaceUnavailableError`][pydantic_ai.workspaces.WorkspaceUnavailableError] if it is missing or
    the host can't be reached. On a timeout or cancellation, a second connection stops the command's
    process group on the host. A background process that keeps the command's output open holds the
    call until it exits, as `sshd` waits for the output to close.

    Args:
        destination: The host, as you'd pass it to `ssh`: `'user@host'`, a `Host` alias from your SSH
            configuration, or `'ssh://user@host:port'`.
        working_dir: Where commands start and relative paths resolve, on the remote host; a relative
            path starts in the login directory, which is the default.
        env: Environment variables for every command, on top of the remote login environment; the
            per-call `env` goes on top.
        ssh_args: Extra `ssh` arguments, such as `['-i', key_path]`, placed before the destination.
