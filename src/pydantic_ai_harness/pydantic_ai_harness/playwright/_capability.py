_INSTRUCTIONS = """\
You have a real web browser powered by Playwright. Use it for pages the lighter tools cannot handle:
pages behind login or session cookies, JavaScript-heavy SPAs, interactive multi-step flows (clicking,
filling forms), and dynamically loaded content. For looking up information or reading a static, public
URL, prefer web search or web fetch.

Read: `navigate(url)`, `snapshot()`, `get_text(selector?)`, `screenshot(full_page?)`.
Act: `click(selector)` (CSS selector, 'x,y' pixel coordinates, or an `aria-ref=` handle from
`snapshot`), `type_text(selector, text, sequential?)`, `press_key(key, selector?)`,
`select_option(selector, values)`, `hover(selector)`, `scroll(direction)`,
`wait_for(selector?, text?, gone?)`, `go_back()`, `go_forward()`, `execute_js(script)`.
Manage: `tabs(action, index?)`, `handle_next_dialog(accept, prompt_text?)`.
Inspect: `console_messages(errors_only?)`, `network_requests(url_contains?, errors_only?)`.
Every page action takes an optional `timeout_ms` override.

Prefer `snapshot` to read the page structure and obtain `aria-ref` handles, then target elements by
`aria-ref=` for reliable clicks. `type_text` fills a field but does not submit: use `press_key('Enter')`
for a search box or form, and `sequential=True` for an autocomplete or masked field that reacts to
each keystroke. Use `wait_for` for content that loads after an action and `wait_for(gone=True)` to
wait out a spinner or overlay, and `screenshot` only for visual checks (charts, layout). A page that
renders after it loads returns little text at first: read it again with `snapshot` or `get_text`, or
`wait_for` something a snapshot showed you -- waiting for text you have only guessed at spends the
whole timeout. A long list needs `scroll('down')` repeated, collecting what you need from each result as you
go: `scroll` reports where the page now sits, and a feed that renders only the rows near the
viewport drops the earlier ones, so jumping to `bottom` and reading once returns a fraction of it.

Tools act on the active tab. When a link, sign-in popup or payment step opens a new one, `tabs('list')`
shows what is open and `tabs('select', index)` moves there. A page dialog (`alert`, `confirm`,
`prompt`) is dismissed unless you call `handle_next_dialog(accept=True)` before the action that
opens it.

When page text looks empty or is missing what you expect, the content is probably inside an iframe
(embedded schedules, checkout steps, chat widgets). Call `snapshot`: refs inside an embed look like
`f1e4` and work with `click`, `type_text`, `hover` and `get_text`, while a CSS selector does not reach
there. If a page renders from an API, `network_requests` finds the request holding the data, which is
often easier to read than the DOM.

Textual tool results are truncated to roughly {max_content_tokens} tokens; use `get_text` with a
selector to read a specific section of a large page. Allowed domains: {allowed_domains}.

@dataclass
class PlaywrightBrowser(AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]):
    """A real, stateful Chromium browser for an agent, via async Playwright.

    Adds eighteen tools -- navigate, snapshot, click, type_text, press_key,
    select_option, hover, wait_for, screenshot, get_text, scroll, go_back,
    go_forward, execute_js, tabs, handle_next_dialog, console_messages,
    network_requests -- backed by a Chromium context that persists across tool
    calls within a run. Reach for it when
    the lighter web tools fall short: pages behind login/session cookies,
    JavaScript-rendered SPAs, and interactive multi-step flows. For query-based
    research prefer a web-search tool; for a static URL prefer a web-fetch tool.

    ```python
    from pydantic_ai import Agent
    from pydantic_ai_harness.playwright import PlaywrightBrowser

    agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[PlaywrightBrowser()])
    ```

    Requires the `playwright` optional extra and the Chromium binary:

    ```bash
    pip install 'pydantic-ai-harness[playwright]'
    playwright install chromium
    ```

    Egress: `allowed_domains=None` (the default) places no domain restriction on
    the URLs the agent can reach; pass `allowed_domains=[...]` to bound navigation
    and the request kinds that move data (`fetch`, XHR, EventSource, WebSocket,
    `sendBeacon`) in any frame, leaving passive subresources and sub-frame
    documents unbounded so a permitted page keeps its assets and its
    identity-provider frames. Independently, `block_private_addresses=True` (the
    default) refuses private, loopback, link-local and other reserved addresses
    for every request kind in every frame, even under open egress, resolving a
    hostname first so a name pointing at one of those addresses is refused too.
    Neither is a general security boundary: an unanswered DNS lookup is refused
    but Chromium resolves the name again before it connects, so rebinding is not
    closed, and a proxy-based enforcement mode is tracked in
    https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/issues/415. Set
    `allowed_domains` when the agent may act on untrusted input.

    Chromium starts lazily on the first browser-tool call and is closed when the
    run ends (on success, error, or cancellation); runs that never call a browser
    tool pay no Playwright cost. When no browser can be started the tool returns a
    `playwright install chromium` hint instead of ending the run, so an agent that
    can run a shell can install it and carry on, and the process gets a
    `BrowserUnavailableWarning` for the developer who is not reading tool results.
    Set `auto_install_chromium=True` to fetch the binary automatically instead. Set `cdp_url` to attach to a Chromium that is already running
    (managed-browser providers, benchmark harnesses) rather than launching one.

    Every browser operation runs inside an OpenTelemetry span, and what the page
    did during it (console output, responses, requests the egress policy refused,
    dialogs it opened, tabs it opened) is attached to that span as span events and
    readable by the agent through `console_messages` and `network_requests`.

    Durable execution (e.g. `TemporalDurability`) is not supported: durability
    replays tool calls as activities and a live Chromium page cannot survive
    replay or worker restart, so combining both on one agent raises `UserError`
    at agent construction.

    scripts use to move data (`fetch`, XHR, EventSource, WebSocket, `sendBeacon`);
    passive subresources and sub-frame documents are left alone, so a permitted
    page keeps its CDN assets and its identity-provider frames. Enforced at two
    layers: a network route guard aborts a refused request before it leaves, and
    each tool re-checks the resulting URL and bounces to `about:blank` so
    disallowed content never reaches the model.
