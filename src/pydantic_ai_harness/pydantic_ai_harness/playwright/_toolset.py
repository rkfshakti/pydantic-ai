"""Playwright toolset -- gives an agent a real, stateful Chromium browser.

External-service assumptions (Playwright SDK + bundled Chromium + `playwright` CLI).
These depend on Playwright internals and Chromium packaging that change on the
vendor's schedule and that the mocked tests do not exercise. Re-verify against the
installed package and the linked sources before changing version, selector, or
teardown handling; bump the date when a fact still holds, update code and date
together when it changed. Pinned in the `[playwright]` extra as
`playwright>=1.61.0` (pyproject.toml). Every fact below was verified against
1.61.0, and the signature-checkable ones re-verified against 1.62.0 on 2026-08-18.

- `page.aria_snapshot(mode='ai')` returns an agent-oriented tree whose nodes carry
  `[ref=eN]` handles. `mode` accepts `Literal['ai', 'default'] | None` through
  1.62.0; the `ref` attributes have shipped since Playwright 1.52. Verified
  2026-08-18.
  Source: <https://playwright.dev/python/docs/aria-snapshots>. Re-check:
  `inspect.signature(playwright.async_api.Page.aria_snapshot)` still offers 'ai'.
- The `aria-ref=eN` handles from that snapshot are resolvable by the `aria-ref=`
  selector engine, so they can be passed straight to `page.click` / `page.fill`.
  Verified 2026-08-18 (engine present in the bundled driver `coreBundle.js`).
  Source: <https://playwright.dev/python/docs/other-locators>. Re-check: pass a
  `snapshot` ref back into `click` against a live page, or grep the installed
  driver bundle for `aria-ref`.
- `browser.new_context(service_workers='block')` disables page service workers;
  the option is `Literal['allow', 'block'] | None` through 1.62.0. Verified
  2026-08-18.
  Source: <https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browsercontext>
  (`serviceWorkers` option). Re-check: inspect the `service_workers` parameter of
  `Browser.new_context`.
- `new_context` accepts downloads by default; `accept_downloads=False` refuses
  them, so a page cannot write attachments to the host's temporary storage.
  Verified 2026-08-18 (parameter documented as "Defaults to `true` where all the
  downloads are accepted"). Source:
  <https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browser#browser-new-context>.
  Re-check: `inspect.getdoc(Browser.new_context)` still states that default.
- `TargetClosedError` is not re-exported from `playwright.async_api` through
  1.62.0; it lives at `playwright._impl._errors`. A driver-raised instance only
  carries `.name`, so `isinstance` is the reliable discriminator. Verified
  2026-08-18.
  Source: <https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python> (async_api `__init__`).
  Re-check: `hasattr(playwright.async_api, 'TargetClosedError')` (expect `False`);
  if it becomes `True`, switch to the public import.
- Missing-binary detection uses `chromium.executable_path` plus an on-disk
  `os.path.exists` check; the install command is `python -m playwright install
  chromium`. Verified 2026-08-18. Source:
  <https://playwright.dev/python/docs/browsers#install-browsers>. Re-check:
  confirm `BrowserType.executable_path` exists and `playwright install chromium`
  still fetches the binary.
- Playwright's own default action/navigation timeout is a single 30000ms, and
  `timeout=0` disables the deadline (the toolset treats 0 the same way in
  `_await_with_timeout`). The defaults here deliberately split that number in two:
  a missed element is usually a wrong selector and should fail fast, while a page
  load legitimately takes longer. Verified 2026-08-18
  (`DEFAULT_PLAYWRIGHT_TIMEOUT_IN_MILLISECONDS = 30000` in `_impl/_helper.py`).
  Source: <https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-page#page-set-default-timeout>.
  Re-check: grep the installed package for `DEFAULT_PLAYWRIGHT_TIMEOUT`.
- `aria-ref=fNeM` handles from a `mode='ai'` snapshot resolve inside the child
  frame they came from: the ref carries the frame sequence and the driver jumps to
  that frame before matching (`_jumpToAriaRefFrameIfNeeded` in the bundled
  driver). Plain CSS selectors do not cross frames, so a snapshot ref is the only
  handle that reaches embedded content. Verified 2026-08-18 against a real
  Chromium (read and click inside a cross-origin child frame).
  Source: <https://playwright.dev/python/docs/other-locators>. Re-check: grep the
  driver bundle for `_jumpToAriaRefFrameIfNeeded`.
- A request aborted by a context route reaches `requestfailed` with the failure
  text `net::ERR_FAILED`, which is what lets the guard's own entry (carrying the
  reason) stand alone in the event log. Verified 2026-08-18 against a real
  Chromium: a refused navigation produced exactly one recorded event. Source:
  <https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-route#route-abort> (`errorCode`
  defaults to `failed`). Re-check: the private-address scenario in
  `scripts/playwright_smoke.py` asserts the single entry.
- Attaching any `page.on('dialog')` handler takes Playwright out of its
  auto-dismiss behavior: the dialog then blocks the page until the handler calls
  `accept`/`dismiss`, so every path through the handler has to answer. Verified
  2026-08-18. Source: <https://playwright.dev/python/docs/dialogs>. Re-check: the
  dialog scenario in `scripts/playwright_smoke.py`.
- A page a site opens (`window.open`, `target="_blank"`) arrives on the opener's
  `popup` event and belongs to the same `BrowserContext`, so the context's route
  guard and storage state already cover it. Its `url` at event time is usually
  still `about:blank`. Verified 2026-08-18. Source:
  <https://playwright.dev/python/docs/pages#handling-new-pages>. Re-check: the
  tab scenario in `scripts/playwright_smoke.py`.
- `locator.press_sequentially(text, timeout=...)` types key by key, unlike
  `page.fill`, which sets the value and dispatches no key events. Verified
  2026-08-18 against 1.62.0. Source:
  <https://playwright.dev/python/docs/input#type-characters>. Re-check:
  `inspect.signature(playwright.async_api.Locator.press_sequentially)`.
- `wait_for_selector(state='hidden')` is satisfied by an element that is hidden
  *or* absent, so a frame that never contained it reports success immediately --
  which is why the disappearance wait requires every frame rather than the first.
  Verified 2026-08-18 against 1.62.0. Source:
  <https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-page#page-wait-for-selector>.
  Re-check: the `state` parameter still accepts `'hidden'`.
- `frame.inner_text('body')` reads a child frame the page-level call cannot see;
  `page.wait_for_selector` matches in the main frame only. Verified 2026-08-18
  against a real Chromium. Source:
  <https://playwright.dev/python/docs/frames>. Re-check: the iframe scenario in
  `scripts/playwright_smoke.py`.

    A tool that acts on an element and a tool that loads a page fail for
    different reasons and deserve different budgets: a selector that matches
    nothing should fail fast, while a page load legitimately takes longer. A
    per-call `timeout_ms` collapses both to the value the model asked for.

    One tool call makes several Playwright calls in sequence, so `action` and
    `navigation` return what is left of the budget, counted from when the
    operation started. Handing every stage the whole number instead would let one
    call spend its deadline once per stage: `navigate(timeout_ms=2000)` waits on a
    goto, a load state, a title, a body read and a screenshot, and would be
    entitled to 2 seconds each.

    Both count down from that one start, which decides which budget each stage
    takes: a page load may legitimately spend the whole navigation budget, and
    the action budget is long gone by then, so the reads that follow it would get
    1ms and fail on arrival. Every stage after a completed `_settle` -- and in
