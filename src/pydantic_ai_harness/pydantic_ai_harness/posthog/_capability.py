"""PostHog hosted MCP capability.

Provider contract, verified 2026-09-24:

- `https://mcp.posthog.com/mcp` is the Streamable HTTP endpoint for both US and EU Cloud. Its edge worker resolves
  the region from the token, so one URL serves every account; an unauthenticated `initialize` returns 401 with
  OAuth protected-resource metadata.
- Authentication is a PostHog personal API key (the "MCP Server" preset) or an OAuth access token, sent as a bearer
  token. The authorization server at `https://oauth.posthog.com` supports dynamic client registration.
- `?features=a,b` limits the server to those feature groups; an empty value means every group.
  `x-posthog-read-only: true` makes the server drop every tool it does not annotate `readOnlyHint`.
- Without an explicit mode the server wraps its tools behind one `posthog` tool driven by commands; this capability
  keeps that default.
