"""Disk-backed store for runtime-authored capabilities.

Each authored capability is one `<name>.py` file under `directory`; a sibling
`manifest.json` indexes them (name, module file, class, status, last validation
error) and is the surface a UI can read. The store mirrors Loopy's persona
persistence: a read-modify-write upsert keyed by name, fail-soft loading that
skips corrupt entries rather than raising.
