    A history passes when:

    1. Every `ToolCallPart` has a matching `ToolReturnPart` or

    2. Every tool return / tool-bound retry resolves a currently-open
       tool call (no orphans, duplicates, or out-of-order returns).

    A `RetryPromptPart` with `tool_name is None` is an output-validation
    retry -- providers map it as a regular user message, not a tool result,
    so it does not need to resolve an open call.

    a failing history is still sendable via `Agent.run(message_history=...)`;
    this predicate now classifies snapshots (`complete` vs `interrupted`,
    see `SnapshotState`) rather than gating what gets persisted.
