`annotate_tool_effect` to find the in-flight tool's run scope.

"""Async-context-local `(live message list, run_step)` refreshed at each node boundary.

The list is held by *reference*, not copied: `after_node_run` re-stashes
`ctx.messages` at every boundary, and `on_run_error` reads the reference's
current content to persist the at-failure history. The `RunContext` passed to
`on_run_error` carries the start-of-run history (a stale reference the graph
rebinds in `UserPromptNode.run`), not the live message list, so the hook cannot
read the partial history from its own `ctx.messages`. See the stash site in
`_capability.py` for the pydantic-ai invariant this leans on.

`run_step` is the last completed boundary's step, so an error-path snapshot's
`step_index` can lag the failing request by one.

Reset to `None` in `wrap_run` so a run never inherits a prior run's tail.
Task-isolated like `current_run_id`.
