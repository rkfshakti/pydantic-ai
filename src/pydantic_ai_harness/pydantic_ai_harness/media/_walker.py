"""JSON walkers that swap inline large parts for externalized markers.

Used by step-persistence backends to keep large payloads out of snapshot
records. The walkers operate on JSON-shaped trees (`list`/`dict`/scalars)
so they never need to know about `pydantic_ai.messages` types directly --
they recognize the serialized shapes emitted by
`ModelMessagesTypeAdapter.dump_json`:

- `BinaryContent`: `{"kind": "binary", "data": "<b64>", ...}`.
- Any message part carrying a string `content` -- every part serializes a
  `part_kind` discriminator, so `TextPart`, `ThinkingPart`, `ToolReturnPart`
  with a string return and a string-valued `UserPromptPart` all match:
  `{"content": "<text>", "part_kind": "<kind>", ...}`.
- `TextContent`, the `UserContent`/`ToolReturn` element that carries text
  inside a part rather than being one: `{"content": "<text>", "kind":
  "text-content", ...}`. It has no `part_kind`, so it needs its own
  discriminator match.

Both kinds go to the same content-addressed `MediaStore`; the marker records
which field was externalized so `restore_media` re-inlines the right one.
Externalizing large text (not just binary) keeps a single snapshot below
MongoDB's 16MB document cap when a tool returns a large string.

Round-trip: `externalize_media` (pre-write) and `restore_media` (post-read)
are inverses for payloads whose byte length is >= threshold. Payloads below
the threshold pass through unchanged.
