The storage plumbing that [`StepPersistence`](../step_persistence/) uses to keep run snapshots small: content-addressed stores and walker helpers that move large binary and text payloads out of message history and put them back on demand.

This package does not define an agent capability.

## Why

A conversation that carries images, audio, or other `BinaryContent` inlines those bytes into every message, and a large text part (a big tool-return string, say) is just as heavy. Persist that history and each snapshot re-serializes the payloads. Content-addressed storage writes each payload once, keyed by its own hash, and leaves a short `media+sha256://` URI in its place. The same bytes are stored once no matter how many messages or snapshots reference them.

## Stores

Every store implements the `MediaStore` protocol: `put`, `get`, `exists`, `public_url`, and `get_metadata`, all async and content-addressed (the URI is derived from the payload hash, so identical bytes deduplicate).

| Store | Backed by | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `DiskMediaStore(directory=...)` | A directory on disk | Local runs and tests |
| `SqliteMediaStore(...)` | A SQLite database | A single-file store that travels with the data |
| `S3MediaStore(...)` | S3 or an S3-compatible bucket | Shared or production storage |
| `MongoMediaStore(...)` | MongoDB (sha256-addressed manual chunking) | A MongoDB deployment; blobs larger than one BSON document, split so no chunk hits the 16 MiB cap |

`MongoMediaStore` needs the `mongodb` extra (which installs `pymongo>=4.17.0`) and is imported the same way (`from pydantic_ai_harness.media import MongoMediaStore`). It stores each blob as sha256-addressed chunks in a `media_chunks` collection, with a `media` manifest document per blob. The chunking bounds each BSON document, so a blob larger than MongoDB's 16 MiB document cap still stores and reads back; it does not bound memory, since `put` takes the whole payload as `bytes` and `get` reassembles every chunk into one `bytearray` (there is no streaming API). The manifest itself holds `MediaContext.metadata` inline and is not chunked, so keep per-blob metadata small. Manual chunking is used instead of GridFS: it keeps content-addressed dedup (GridFS keys files by `ObjectId` and does none) and stays fully testable in-memory.

uv:

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-harness[mongodb]"
```

pip:

```bash
pip install "pydantic-ai-harness[mongodb]"
```

`collection=` (default `'media'`) names the manifest collection and derives the chunk collection as `<collection>_chunks`. `chunk_size_bytes=` (default 8 MiB) sets the split size and is rejected below 1 byte or above 16 MiB minus 64 KiB of headroom for the chunk document's own fields. On the first `put` or `get` the store issues `createIndex` for a compound `(files_id, n)` index on the chunk collection, without which reassembly is a collection scan -- so the connecting user needs the privilege to create indexes, and an already-populated collection pays the index build on that first call.

A `KeyStrategy` controls the on-store layout for `DiskMediaStore` and `S3MediaStore` (`SqliteMediaStore` and `MongoMediaStore` key on the digest itself, so they take `table=` / `collection=` instead), and a `PublicUrlResolver` (or `make_static_public_url`) turns a stored URI into a public URL when the store is served over HTTP.

## Walker helpers

`externalize_media` and `restore_media` walk a message node and swap payloads for URIs and back.

```python
store = DiskMediaStore(directory='./media')

# Replace binary and text payloads at or above the threshold with media+sha256:// URIs.
lean = await externalize_media(message, media_store=store, threshold_bytes=32_000)

# Later, rehydrate the URIs back into the original parts.
full = await restore_media(lean, media_store=store)
```

`externalize_media` externalizes both large `BinaryContent` and large text: any message part whose string `content` is at least `threshold_bytes` UTF-8 bytes (`TextPart`, `ThinkingPart`, a string-returning `ToolReturnPart`, a string-valued `UserPromptPart`), plus any `TextContent` element travelling inside a `UserPromptPart.content` sequence or a `ToolReturn`. The same `threshold_bytes` governs both; there is no separate text knob. Payloads below the threshold stay inline, and `restore_media` re-inlines binary and text symmetrically. `media_uri_for` and `parse_media_uri` give you the raw URI round-trip if you need to key media yourself.

The current reader restores binary markers written before text externalization. That compatibility is upgrade-only: a release that predates text externalization treats every marker as binary, so it cannot validate a snapshot containing an externalized text marker. Keep a current reader for persisted snapshots that contain those markers.

If a payload uses the same namespaced keys as the marker format, the writer moves those values into a versioned reserved mapping and the current reader restores them. A marker written before this escaping format was added still restores. The reader treats the reserved keys as its own only when the reserved mapping has the shape the writer produces and the version key carries a stamp from the format's own namespace, so a payload that happened to carry either or both is left alone. A marker carrying both, stamped with a version this reader does not know, is rejected rather than restored with the reserved values stripped. Compatibility the other way is upgrade-only. A reader that predates the escaping format re-inlines the externalized field correctly, but it leaves the caller's values in the reserved mapping instead of restoring them to their own keys, and leaves the two reserved keys in the payload. Keep a current reader for persisted snapshots that contain escaped markers.
