"""Grain hosted MCP capability.

Provider contract, verified 2026-09-24:

- `https://api.grain.com/_/mcp` is the Streamable HTTP endpoint; there is one host, with no regional variants.
  An unauthenticated POST answers 401 with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=...`, and an unknown bearer
  token answers 401 `invalid_token`.
- Authentication is a Grain OAuth access token, sent as a bearer token. The protected-resource metadata names
  `https://api.grain.com` as the authorization server, which supports PKCE and dynamic client registration.
- The server has tools that change data: Grain's 2026-05-13 release added creating clips and tagging meetings.
  `read_only` keeps only the tools the server marks read-only.

Re-check by sending an unauthenticated POST to the endpoint.
