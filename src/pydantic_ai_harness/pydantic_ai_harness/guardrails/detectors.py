"""Ready-made checks to plug into a guard.

These are plain functions returning a
[`GuardrailResult`][pydantic_ai_harness.GuardrailResult], not capabilities. That is the
difference that makes them compose: several go into one `InputGuardrail` or
`OutputGuardrail` and run as a chain, next to whatever you write yourself, sharing
one place in the capability list and one set of spans.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import InputGuardrail
from pydantic_ai_harness.guardrails.detectors import blocked_keywords, redact_secrets

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.4',
    capabilities=[InputGuardrail(guard=[redact_secrets, blocked_keywords(['internal-only'])])],
)
```

They read text, so they suit a prompt directly. A structured agent output is
not text, and replacing one with a scrubbed string would change its type, so
reach for [`for_text`][pydantic_ai_harness.guardrails.detectors.for_text] to
say what should happen there.

What these cannot do is worth stating. A regex finds a credential because
credentials have a shape; it does not find a prompt injection, which is
ordinary language, and it does not understand context.

That last point has a concrete cost for `email`, which matches anything shaped
like an address because that is all an address is:

```python
redact_personal_data('git clone git@github.com:pydantic/pydantic-ai.git')
# -> replaces `git@github.com`, leaving a command that no longer runs
```

An input guard rewrites the prompt in place, so the model receives the broken
version. On an agent that handles code or paths, reach for
`personal_data(only=['us_ssn', 'credit_card', 'iban'])`, or apply the detector
to the output rather than the prompt. Treat all of these as one cheap layer,
not as the answer.
