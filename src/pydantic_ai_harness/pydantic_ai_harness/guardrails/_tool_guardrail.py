"""Tool guardrail capability.

`ToolGuardrail` is the third guardrail edge. `InputGuardrail` screens the user prompt
and `OutputGuardrail` screens the agent output, but neither sees a tool call:
`InputGuardrail` evaluates only the first model request, so everything a tool sends
out and everything a tool brings back passes unchecked. That matters because
tool results are where untrusted content enters an agent loop -- fetched pages,
file contents, MCP server responses.

`ToolGuardrail` inspects both sides of a tool call with the same
[`GuardrailResult`][pydantic_ai_harness.GuardrailResult] vocabulary the other two
guards use:

- `guard` sees the validated arguments before the tool runs.
- `result_guard` sees the tool's return value before it reaches the model.

Verdicts map onto Pydantic AI control flow rather than a parallel mechanism:
`block` uses [`SkipToolExecution`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.SkipToolExecution] so
the refusal becomes the tool result and the agent can recover, `retry` raises
[`ModelRetry`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.ModelRetry], and `approve` raises
[`ApprovalRequired`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.ApprovalRequired] so the call joins
the run's deferred approval flow.

    | `block` | skip execution; the refusal message becomes the tool result | the refusal message replaces the result |
    | `replace` | run the tool with substituted arguments (a mapping) | substitute a sanitized result |
    | `retry` | ask the model to redo the call | ask the model to redo the call |
    | `approve` | defer the call for human approval | not valid; raises `UserError` |

    `block` is the graceful path on both stages: the agent sees the refusal text

    first parameter when it needs run state, such as `deps` for role-aware
    policy. The parameter is detected from the signature.

    Scope: output tools do not fire tool-execution hooks in Pydantic AI, so a
    guard never sees the call that produces the agent's structured output --
    use `OutputGuardrail` for that.

    Ordering: declares `position='innermost'`. Argument hooks run outermost
    first, so the guard sees the arguments every other capability has already
    finished modifying; result hooks run innermost first, so the guard sees the
    raw tool result before a capability such as `ToolOutputLimits`
    truncates or offloads it.
