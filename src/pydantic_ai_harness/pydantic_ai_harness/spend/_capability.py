"""Track what an agent spends, and stop it when a budget is gone.

`UsageLimits` in Pydantic AI caps tokens, requests and cost for the duration of
one run. `SpendLimits` covers what that leaves: periods longer than a run,
partitioning by tenant or user, and a counter that several worker processes
share. It prices each response with
[`ModelResponse.cost()`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelResponse.cost], adds it to
every configured window, and refuses the next request once a window is spent.

The gate is local and immediate. Provider usage APIs and observability backends
aggregate after the fact and are read by polling, so a number there moves only
once the requests behind it have already been made -- enough to reconcile a
counter, not enough to stop the request a runaway loop is about to make.

    the check before any of them records anything. This is a brake on a runaway

    State lives across runs on purpose, so `for_run` is left alone: a daily
    budget that reset every run would not be a daily budget. Per-run isolation
    comes from `Budget(window='run')`, whose key carries the run id.
