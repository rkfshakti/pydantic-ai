# Spend

Track what an agent costs, and stop it when a budget is gone.

> [!NOTE]
> While Pydantic AI Harness is on 0.x releases, the API may change between minor releases; when it does, deprecation warnings and release-note migration guidance tell you (or your agent) exactly how to upgrade. See the [version policy](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/#version-policy).

## The problem

A loop that calls a model until a condition it never reaches will keep calling until something stops it. `UsageLimits` in Pydantic AI is that stop for one run: it caps tokens, requests and cost for the duration of a single `run()`. What it does not cover is a period longer than one run, a per-tenant share of a shared allowance, or a counter that several worker processes agree on. A daily ceiling spread across a queue's workers is exactly the case where each worker independently believes it has the whole budget.

Provider usage APIs do not close that gap. They are billing and observability pipelines: usage is aggregated after the fact and read by polling, so a number there moves only once the requests behind it have already been made. That is enough to reconcile a ledger and not enough to refuse the request a runaway loop is about to make.

## The solution

`SpendLimits` prices each model response it records with [`ModelResponse.cost()`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/api/messages/), adds it to each window you configure, and refuses the next request once a window is spent.

```python
from decimal import Decimal

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import SpendLimits
from pydantic_ai_harness.spend import Budget

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.4',
    capabilities=[SpendLimits(budgets=[Budget(usd=Decimal('100'), window='day')])],
)
```

Past $100 in a UTC day, the next request raises `SpendLimitExceeded`.

## Budgets

A budget is a ceiling, a period, and optionally a partition. They compose, so several apply at once:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

from pydantic_ai_harness import SpendLimits
from pydantic_ai_harness.spend import Budget

SpendLimits(
    budgets=[
        Budget(usd=Decimal('5'), window='run'),  # one runaway run
        Budget(usd=Decimal('100'), window='day'),  # the whole deployment, per day
        Budget(usd=Decimal('2000'), window='month', warn_at=0.8),
        Budget(usd=Decimal('10'), window='day', scope=lambda ctx: ctx.deps.tenant_id, name='tenant'),
    ]
)
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `usd` / `tokens` | ceilings; set either, both, or neither |
| `window` | `run`, `conversation`, `day`, `month`, `total` |
| `scope` | derives a partition key from the run, so tenants count separately; typed against the agent's `deps` |
| `warn_at` | fraction past which `BudgetStatus.warning` is set; never blocks |
| `name` | distinguishes budgets sharing a window and scope |
| `retain` | how long the counter is kept after its last write; `'window default'`, `'forever'`, or a `timedelta` |

A window rolls over by producing a different store key rather than by resetting a counter, so a new day is simply a new key and nothing has to run at midnight. A `total` counter never expires. `run` and `conversation` buckets never roll over either, so expiry there hands back the ceiling rather than starting a new period -- but each mints a key per run or per conversation, so they carry a long horizon (24 hours and 30 days) instead, past which the counter is dropped rather than kept forever. That default is a compromise, and it is visible: a conversation resumed past its horizon starts from zero again, so set `retain='forever'` where a conversation ceiling has to hold for as long as the conversation does, and clean the keys up some other way.

Budgets that share a `name`, `window`, and `scope` share one counter, which is how a single window carries both a USD and a token ceiling. The response is added to that counter once, not once per budget. Two budgets that share a `name` and `window` but declare *different* `scope` callables are refused at construction: they are different dimensions -- per tenant and per user, say -- and nothing stops the two returning the same string, which would merge them into one counter. Give them different names, or pass the same callable to both. Budgets that do share a counter must also agree on `retain`: one counter has one expiry, and the accrual writes whichever of them is listed first, so disagreeing would let declaration order decide when a `'forever'` ceiling rolls over.

`Budget` is generic in the agent's dependency type, so a `scope` is checked against it: pass the capability to an `Agent` with a `deps_type` and a scope reaching for a field those deps do not have is a type error rather than an `AttributeError` on the first request.

**A budget with no ceiling is a counter.** It accumulates and reports and never refuses anything, which is how per-tenant accounting with no cap is expressed:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness import SpendLimits
from pydantic_ai_harness.spend import Budget

SpendLimits(budgets=[Budget(window='month', scope=lambda ctx: ctx.deps.tenant_id, name='chargeback')])
```

## What the gate guarantees

Once a recorded response spends a window, `SpendLimits` refuses the next request.

Not: that spend stays under the ceiling. The request that crosses the line completes, and concurrent runs can each pass the check before any of them records anything. A stream the caller abandons part-way never reaches the accounting hook, so its tokens are billed by the provider and invisible here. Treat this as a brake on a runaway loop, not as an accounting ledger; reconcile against the provider's own numbers if you need the second thing.

## Reading the numbers

```python
from decimal import Decimal

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import SpendLimits
from pydantic_ai_harness.spend import Budget, SpendRecordedEvent

limits = SpendLimits(budgets=[Budget(usd=Decimal('100'))])
agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[limits])

@agent.on_event(SpendRecordedEvent)
async def show(ctx, event):
    print(f'{event.model} cost ${event.usd}')
```

`SpendRecordedEvent` is emitted after each response `SpendLimits` records, including one that `on_unpriced='raise'` is about to reject. Its flat payload carries the response usage and serializable budget readings. Under durable execution, orchestration can deliver it again even though the journaled accrual ran only once, so keep a listener that writes an audit record or emits a billing event idempotent.

Migration: `on_spend` remains supported but is deprecated. Move its callback body to a `SpendRecordedEvent` subscription; the same idempotency requirement applies to it.

`status()` reads the same numbers without a run, which is what a cost display in a UI wants:

```python {names="defined"}
from pydantic_ai_harness import SpendLimits


async def report(limits: SpendLimits[None]) -> None:
    for status in await limits.status(scope='acme'):
        print(status.budget.name, status.spent.usd, status.exhausted)
```

Without a run context, budgets on a `run` or `conversation` window are omitted, and so is a budget declaring a `scope` unless `scope=` names the partition to read. Pass `ctx` inside a run and every budget resolves.

Set `expose_tools=True` to give the agent a `get_spend` tool. It is off by default: a tool costs schema tokens on every request, and most applications want the number on a screen rather than in the model's context.

## Reacting to a threshold

Spend events are reporting signals, not approval points: they can follow the response carrying the final answer.

The seam that runs before a request rather than after a response is `before_model_request`. A small capability of your own can read `status(ctx)` there and hold the run until someone decides:

```python {names="defined"}
import asyncio
from dataclasses import dataclass
from decimal import Decimal

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import AbstractCapability
from pydantic_ai.models import ModelRequestContext
from pydantic_ai.tools import RunContext

from pydantic_ai_harness import SpendLimits
from pydantic_ai_harness.spend import Budget

limits = SpendLimits[None](budgets=[Budget(usd=Decimal('100'), warn_at=0.8)])
approvals: asyncio.Queue[bool] = asyncio.Queue()


@dataclass
class ApproveBeforeSpending(AbstractCapability[None]):
    async def before_model_request(
        self, ctx: RunContext[None], request_context: ModelRequestContext
    ) -> ModelRequestContext:
        if any(status.warning for status in await limits.status(ctx)) and not await approvals.get():
            raise RuntimeError('spending past the warning threshold was not approved')
        return request_context


agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.4', deps_type=type(None), capabilities=[limits, ApproveBeforeSpending()])
```

The gate reads numbers `SpendLimits` has already accrued, because the previous response was counted inside `wrap_model_request` before this request was prepared. It gates the first request of a run too, which is what carries a threshold crossed by an earlier run into the next one. A capability listed after it can still skip the request with `SkipModelRequest`, so an approval taken here is not proof that a request followed.

That pause holds a coroutine, so it lasts as long as the process does and no longer. To pause across processes, gate the spending at a tool call instead: [deferred tool calls](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/tools-toolsets/deferred-tools/) end the run with a serializable request for approval, and a later run resumes it with the deferred tool results. Or stop the run and resume it later from its message history, as described below.

For a ceiling that expands rather than stops, `budgets` is read fresh on every request, so replacing it after a refusal lets the work continue against the larger ceiling. The counter is keyed on `name`, `window`, `scope` and the period the window is currently in, never on the ceiling, so what is already spent carries over.

A refusal can land mid-run, after tool calls have already run and been paid for. Re-running the original prompt would repeat that work and any side effects it had, so resume from what the refused run produced instead: `capture_run_messages` holds the partial history, and a run given that history and no new prompt continues from the request that was refused.

```python {names="defined"}
import dataclasses
from decimal import Decimal

from pydantic_ai import Agent, capture_run_messages

from pydantic_ai_harness import SpendLimits
from pydantic_ai_harness.spend import Budget, SpendLimitExceeded

limits = SpendLimits[None](budgets=[Budget(usd=Decimal('1'), name='daily')])
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.4', deps_type=type(None), capabilities=[limits])


async def ask(prompt: str, ceiling: Decimal) -> str:
    with capture_run_messages() as messages:
        try:
            return (await agent.run(prompt)).output
        except SpendLimitExceeded:
            (budget,) = limits.budgets
            limits.budgets = [dataclasses.replace(budget, usd=ceiling)]
            resumable = list(messages)
    return (await agent.run(message_history=resumable)).output
```

Assigning `budgets` does not repeat the checks the constructor runs over budget combinations, so keep a replacement to the same names, windows, and scopes. It also raises the ceiling for every run sharing this `SpendLimits`, not just the one that was refused, and nothing lowers it again.

## Sharing a counter across processes

The default store keeps counters in the process, which catches a runaway loop inside one worker and does nothing for a budget spread across a queue. `RedisSpendStore` is the shared counter:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

from redis.asyncio import Redis

from pydantic_ai_harness import SpendLimits
from pydantic_ai_harness.spend import Budget, RedisSpendStore

store = RedisSpendStore(Redis.from_url('redis://localhost'))
limits = SpendLimits(budgets=[Budget(usd=Decimal('100'), window='day')], store=store)
```

It adds no dependency: `RedisClient` is a protocol of the two coroutines used, so any compatible client satisfies it. Amounts are stored as integer billionths of a dollar rather than through `INCRBYFLOAT`, which accumulates rounding error over the tens of thousands of requests a busy day produces. Billionths rather than millionths because the residue does not average out: an agent repeats requests of near-identical shape, so the same fraction rounds the same way every time.

Every window a response counts against is applied as one Lua script, so no other client sees the response part-applied: not across the four counters of one window, and not across the windows themselves. A response counting against a day budget and a month budget is one script rather than two, so there is no failure between them to leave the day counted and the month not. The one exception is the overflow below: it aborts the script where it happens and leaves the windows already applied, which takes a counter near $9.22 billion to reach. Each key also costs a second read for as long as the compatibility fallback below is in place.

A failure *after* the server has run a script does not say whether it committed -- the connection can drop once `EVAL` has landed -- so a write that errors leaves the outcome unknown rather than untried. Nothing retries it: counting a billed response twice is a direction the brake survives, and counting it zero times is not.

The counters do not round. `HINCRBY` is 64-bit integer arithmetic and takes its increment as a string, so what Redis holds is exact, and the totals come back as bulk strings read with `HMGET` rather than as the integer replies `HINCRBY` returns -- those become Lua numbers, which are doubles, and would round a total past `2**53` billionths on the way out. What is left is `HINCRBY`'s own range: a counter passing the signed 64-bit range, around **$9.22 billion** against a single key, which Redis refuses before writing that field.

Keys are `{prefix}:budget-key`, with the braces around the prefix literal. That is a Redis Cluster hash tag, so the slot comes from the prefix alone and every key of one store lands in the same slot, which is what lets one script take several of them. The cost is that a cluster cannot spread a store's keys across its nodes, and that a `prefix` of your own is refused at construction if it is empty or carries a brace of its own, either of which stops the tag being read as one. `BudgetStatus.key` reports the budget key without the prefix, so what it shows is unchanged. The dedup markers below share that namespace, so a key beginning `dedup|` is refused: it would name a marker, which holds a string, and the counter would fail with `WRONGTYPE` rather than accumulate. No budget produces such a key -- the second segment of one is always a window -- so this only reaches a caller driving the store itself.

A counter written by an earlier release, under the untagged name, is read alongside the tagged one and added to it, so an upgrade needs no migration step. Added rather than moved: a move would have to decide when it is complete, and nothing here can know that, since a worker still on the old release can write to the old name at any point in a rolling deploy and a move that already ran would never pick that up. The cost is one extra read per key, on reads and writes alike.

The compatibility only runs one way, which is worth planning around on three counts. A **rolling deploy** under-counts while it lasts: an upgraded worker sees both names, but one still on the old release reads only the untagged one and cannot see what the upgraded workers have written, so it admits requests against a total that is missing them. A **downgrade** loses the tagged counter outright for the same reason, and this release never writes the old name, so nothing carries back. And the old key's **expiry is frozen** at whatever the last old-release write set: nothing here refreshes it, so it goes when it goes and the total drops by what it held. Keep the deploy short, and treat a downgrade as a reset rather than a rollback.

The fallback goes away in 0.28.0. A counter still living under the old name stops being counted at that point, so a window set to `retain='forever'`, or one whose horizon outlasts the gap between the two releases, is worth moving by hand before then.

`add_many` carries a token identifying the response, and `RedisSpendStore` reads a marker for it before the increments and writes it after them, inside the same script. `InMemorySpendStore` remembers the same tokens under its lock, so the default store behaves the same way while its process survives. The token combines the run id and step with a digest of replay-stable response content, usage, and provider identity; it excludes clock-derived and arbitrary provider bookkeeping. The token layer protects recovery that presents an entry without consulting the journal only when the caller supplies the same `run_id` to `Agent.run` on the original run and its recovery. When `run_id` is omitted, Pydantic AI creates a fresh one and the store cannot recognise the entry. Ordinary durable replay remains protected by the journaled `_accrue` operation regardless. Markers are held for `dedup_retain`, a field on both stores, an hour by default, or for the window's own horizon where that is shorter, and cost one small key per response per window. That horizon is the window in which recovery outside the durable journal is recognised, not the counter's lifetime: a response presented again later is counted again, which is the direction to err in, since a brake that trips early survives and one that releases late does not. Set `dedup_retain=None` to hold no markers and apply every entry, which also gives up that store-side protection. Recognition starts at the upgrade either way: a response an earlier release counted left no marker behind, so presenting that response again counts it again.

The default store is built per capability, so two `SpendLimits` instances do not quietly share one counter. Pass the same store object to both when you want them to. `InMemorySpendStore` cannot survive worker replacement: a replacement process has neither the counters nor the deduplication markers accumulated by the first one. Use a shared store for durable workflows that can recover on another worker.

A store that fails does not fail quietly. An error reading the counter refuses the request, which is the safe direction. An error writing it propagates out of the run after the model has already answered and been charged. That is deliberate: a swallowed write would drift the counter down and weaken the gate, which is worse than a visible failure. If your deployment would rather keep the answer than the count, wrap the store and decide there.

Any object with `get_many` and `add_many` works, so a Postgres or DynamoDB counter is a small class rather than a fork. Four obligations come with writing one. Return a total for every key you were handed, keyed by `SpendEntry.key`, including one you skipped as a replay. A missing total raises `UserError`, which names either this store contract or a non-deterministic scope during durable replay as the cause. Read a key that was never written as zero rather than leaving it out. Skip an entry whose `token` has already been applied to that key, or recovery outside the durable journal can count one response twice. And apply the whole call or none of it -- the guarantee at the top of this section is only as good as the backend behind it, and a store that commits each entry as it goes puts back the split write this seam exists to remove. Neither method is ever handed an empty sequence, so there is no such case to answer for.

`SpendStore`, the single-key `get` and `add` pair released in 0.17.0, is deprecated: a store of that shape still works, driven one window per call, and emits one `HarnessDeprecationWarning` when the `SpendLimits` holding it is constructed. The warning names both losses: windows are applied one at a time, and the token has nowhere to go. A durable journal still prevents duplicate execution while its record is available, but recovery that cannot consult that journal has no store-side deduplication. The single-key `get` and `add` on `InMemorySpendStore` and `RedisSpendStore` are deprecated too. A direct call to either does not warn, so this is the notice; reach for `get_many` and `add_many` instead. A subclass that *overrode* one of them without also overriding the batch pair is warned when the store itself is constructed, because that case loses behavior rather than just naming a deprecated method: `SpendLimits` drives `get_many` and `add_many`, so an override on `get` or `add` is never called and whatever it added -- an audit, a mirrored write -- stops happening. Move it onto `get_many` or `add_many`, which is also what makes the warning stop.

## Pricing

Prices come from [genai-prices](https://github.com/pydantic/genai-prices) via `ModelResponse.cost()`, per response: cache and tier pricing are per request, so summing usage across requests and pricing the total gives the wrong number.

A model the registry does not know -- a local deployment, a negotiated rate -- is handled by `price`:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

from pydantic_ai_harness import SpendLimits

SpendLimits(price=lambda response: Decimal('0.002') if response.model_name == 'internal-7b' else None)
```

An amount returned by `price` must be finite and not negative. Anything else -- a credit, a `NaN`, an infinity -- fails the run with `UserError`, because a credit moves a budget away from its ceiling and the other two are a broken pricing function rather than a price. An exception raised by `price` is reported through the same `UserError` path. The response is still recorded first: it was billed by the provider whatever the function returned, so its tokens and request count are accrued and `on_spend` fires before the error is raised. When one lifecycle committed several provider responses, an error pricing or reporting one response is deferred until the remaining responses accrue.

Under durable execution, `price` and each budget's `scope` callable must be deterministic for the same response and run context. Pricing runs in orchestration outside the journaled accrual, so a changed result can make `on_spend` disagree with the recorded counter or turn a successful recovery into a pricing error. Moving it into a durable operation would require the durability backend to serialize the complete provider response, including arbitrary metadata, so the callable remains outside that boundary. A changed scope selects a different store key from the one in the recorded accrual; `SpendLimits` reports that mismatch as a `UserError` naming the determinism requirement.

Returning `None` falls through to the registry. When nothing can price a response, `on_unpriced` decides: `'zero'` (the default) counts it as free and increments `Spent.unpriced_requests` so the gap is visible, and `'raise'` fails the run with `UnpricedModelError`. Either way the response is recorded first and the tokens are counted, so a token ceiling still holds for a model with no price and an application that catches the error does not carry on against an understated counter. Under `'zero'` a USD ceiling is the one that cannot hold: nothing priceable accrues, so no number of such requests reaches it. That combination -- `'zero'` plus a `usd` budget -- warns once per model with `UnpricedModelWarning`, rather than once per request. If callers choose the model, prefer `'raise'` or supply `price`.

## Composition

State lives across runs deliberately, so `for_run` is not overridden: a daily budget that reset every run would not be a daily budget. Per-run isolation comes from `Budget(window='run')`, whose key carries the run id.

`defer_loading=True` is refused. A deferred capability's hooks do not run until the model loads it, so an exhausted budget would not stop a request and the requests made meanwhile would go uncounted -- a brake the thing being braked decides when to apply.

`SpendLimits` accrues every response the provider billed, even one that a hook nested inside it rejects or replaces, so where you list it among other capabilities doesn't change what it counts. Core merges a successful continuation chain into one response, so `price` and `on_spend` each run once for its combined usage; a continuation that was partly billed before an error hook recovered is accrued response by response. A cached response, or one supplied with `SkipModelRequest`, never reached the provider and is not charged.

**Durable execution.** `SpendLimits` supports Pydantic AI durability capabilities. Its clock read, counter read, and accrual are separate durable operations. Temporal therefore reads the clock in an activity rather than workflow orchestration, and DBOS or Prefect record the same boundary in their own durable units. On replay, the engine returns each operation's recorded result without reading the clock or store again. The response is accrued once, and the window key comes from the original recorded clock value.

Attach the durability capability to the same agent as `SpendLimits`. Running a `SpendLimits` agent directly inside a Temporal workflow without `TemporalDurability` leaves the clock read in workflow orchestration; the sandbox error is translated into advice to attach durability.

The journal covers replay while its records are available. Store-side idempotency covers a different recovery path: one that presents the same `SpendEntry` without consulting the recorded accrual. A `BatchSpendStore` uses the replay-stable token to apply that entry once within `dedup_retain`. A deprecated `SpendStore` drops the token and warns, so it cannot provide this second layer. `InMemorySpendStore` can deduplicate only while recovery reaches the same process. Use a shared `BatchSpendStore`, such as `RedisSpendStore`, when recovery can land on another worker.

`exhausted()` remains useful as a workflow admission check without a `RunContext`:

```python {names="defined"}
from collections.abc import Awaitable, Callable

from pydantic_ai_harness import SpendLimits


async def start_if_funded(
    limits: SpendLimits[None], tenant_id: str, start_workflow: Callable[[], Awaitable[object]]
) -> None:
    if await limits.exhausted(scope=tenant_id):
        raise RuntimeError('daily budget exhausted')
    await start_workflow()
```

`exhausted` rather than `any(s.exhausted for s in await limits.status(...))`: `status` omits
the budgets it cannot resolve, and `any()` over what is left is a brake that passes having
inspected nothing -- which is exactly what a `SpendLimits` whose budgets are all scoped returns when
the scope is missing. `exhausted` raises there instead, naming the budgets that need a
`scope` or a run context. Use `status` for a reading, `exhausted` for a decision.

Admission is all that call does: it reserves nothing. The durable operations then account for the workflow's model responses. Issue [#531](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/issues/531) tracks this support and its remaining store-lifetime limits.

For a ceiling that covers one run and nothing else, Pydantic AI's own
[`UsageLimits`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/core-concepts/agent/#usage-limits) does the same job
in-process with no store and no capability: `total_tokens_limit` for tokens and `cost_limit` for
money, both over a single `run()`. An unpriced response adds nothing to `RunUsage.cost`, so
`cost_limit` measures a run against whichever part of it could be priced: a `CostNotFoundWarning`
after the run when none of it was, and silence when only some of it was. `SpendLimits` counts the
same gap and lets `on_unpriced` decide what to do about it. `UsageLimits` also carries the two
input-token granularities `SpendLimits` has no equivalent for: `input_tokens_limit` is cumulative
over the run, and `per_request_input_tokens_limit` caps one request against the provider-reported
input tokens of the response that already paid for it. `count_tokens_before_request=True` counts
the pending request with the model's own `count_tokens` and applies both limits to that count
before the send, so an oversized context is refused rather than billed on the providers that
implement `count_tokens`; the field names them, and a model without it raises
`NotImplementedError` instead. Reach for `Budget(tokens=..., window='run')` when the same
configuration also has to express a window longer than one run, a tenant scope, or a counter
shared between processes.

## Tracing

A refusal emits a `spend budget exhausted` span with `spend.budget` and `spend.window`. Accrual emits nothing: a span per model request would double the size of a trace without adding a decision. `spend.scope` is attached only when `RunContext.trace_include_content` is set, since a scope key is usually a tenant or user id and a trace has a wider audience than the application that produced it.

## Specs

`Agent.from_spec` supports the part of the configuration a spec can express:

```yaml
- SpendLimits:
    budgets:
      - {usd: '100', window: day}
      - {usd: '2000', window: month, warn_at: 0.8}
    on_unpriced: raise
```

`store`, `price`, `on_spend`, `clock`, and a budget's `scope` take callables or live objects. A spec naming them is rejected rather than silently ignored, because a spec that promises per-tenant scoping and does not deliver it is worse than one that refuses to load.

The fields above are what `SpendLimits.from_spec` names in its signature, which is also what Pydantic AI reads to generate the spec's JSON schema -- so an editor following the `$schema` line completes and validates them. `BudgetSpec` is the entry shape, exported for anyone building a spec in code.

## API

`SpendLimits`, `Budget`, `SpendSnapshot`, `BudgetStatus`, `Spent`, `BatchSpendStore`,
`SpendEntry`, `SpendStore`, `InMemorySpendStore`, `RedisSpendStore`, `SpendLimitExceeded`,
`UnpricedModelError`, and `UnpricedModelWarning` are exported from
`pydantic_ai_harness.spend`. Signatures and defaults are rendered from the source on the
[docs page](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/spend/), which is the copy that cannot drift.

`BatchSpendStore` is the protocol `SpendLimits` drives. `add_many` is handed every window of one
response together, each window's share carried by a `SpendEntry`, so a backend that can apply the
set as one unit does and no failure leaves the response counted against the day and not the month.
Both bundled stores apply it as one unit; a custom one has to arrange that itself, because nothing
here rolls a partial write back. `SpendEntry.token` is what lets a store apply a re-executed
accrual once. `SpendStore`, which takes one window per call and
carries no token, is deprecated. A store of that shape still works, through
an adapter that warns once at construction about what it gives up.

`SpendLimitExceeded` subclasses `UsageLimitExceeded`, so code that already stops on a usage limit stops here too, while code that needs to tell a spent daily budget from an over-long run can catch it specifically. `UnpricedModelError` subclasses `UserError`.
