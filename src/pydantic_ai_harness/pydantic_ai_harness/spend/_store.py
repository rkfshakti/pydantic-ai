"""Where spend counters live.

`BatchSpendStore` is the seam between the gate and its counter. The default keeps
counters in the process, which catches a runaway loop inside one worker; a
shared store is what makes a budget hold across the workers of a queue.

The seam takes every window of a response at once. One response counts against
every configured window, so applying them one at a time leaves a failure between
two of them counted in one window and not the other, which reads as less spend
than really happened.
