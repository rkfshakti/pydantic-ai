"""Report a capability arrangement that can bill a response the accrual never sees.

`SpendLimits` accrues inside its own `wrap_model_request`, so anything nested further in
can reject a response the counter has not recorded yet. Pydantic AI sorts the `innermost`
tier against everything else but not against itself, so the arrangement is reached by
listing capabilities in a particular order rather than by anything going wrong, and the
resulting chain is readable from
[`RunContext.root_capability`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.root_capability].

What is read here is the ordering. Whether a nested wrapper actually rejects a billed
response depends on its own configuration and on how a given run races, none of which is
visible from the chain, so this reports an arrangement rather than an under-count that has
happened. That is also why it warns rather than refuses.

    the arrangement rather than on the first call is what lets a reused agent be read again:
    `agent.run(capabilities=[...])` can put a different chain around the same capability
    instance on every run, and a flag set by the first, safe chain would hide every later one.

    The arrangement is recorded after `warnings.warn` returns rather than before, so that an
    application escalating this category to an error with `filterwarnings('error', ...)` keeps
    getting one on every run of the arrangement. Recording it first would let the raise happen

    The question is whether it brings a `wrap_model_request` of its own that could await a
    response and then raise. Two kinds of capability define the method unconditionally, so
    defining it says nothing about them:

    - [`Hooks`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.Hooks] dispatches to whatever hook functions were
      registered, and the registry that would say whether one was is private. Core publishes
      `has_wrap_node_run` and `has_wrap_run_event_stream` but no equivalent for model requests;
      asked for in [pydantic-ai#7177](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues/7177).
      Read as "no" until that lands.
    - [`WrapperCapability`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.WrapperCapability] delegates straight to
      `self.wrapped`, which is the capability that actually decides, so the question moves
      there. A wrapper over a real rejector is still reported, under the wrapper's own name,
      which is the name the reader put in the list.

    A subclass of either that overrides the method supplies its own and is answered on that.

    A durable-execution capability is read as "no" for a different reason: its wrapper
    dispatches work rather than rejecting a response. Core requires that dispatch to be the
    innermost wrapper (`BaseDurabilityCapability.get_ordering`), so the report's usual advice
    to reorder `SpendLimits` would be unavailable. The clock, reads, and accrual instead cross
    that boundary through `durable_operation`. Matched by `isinstance` against the public base
    shared by the bundled Temporal, DBOS, and Prefect integrations.

    Everything else is reported, including a capability that would not have rejected anything
    on the run in hand. `InputGuardrail` is the case in point: it can reach a billed response
    only under `parallel=True`, and that field is deliberately not read. `parallel` can be
    flipped without moving anything in the list, so the ordering is the durable property and
    the one the reader controls; and a capability that silenced its own report by reading a
    sibling's field would go quiet the day that field stopped meaning what it means here.
