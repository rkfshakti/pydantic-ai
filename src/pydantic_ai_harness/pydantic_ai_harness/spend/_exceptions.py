    contributes nothing in dollars, so that ceiling cannot be reached however
    many such requests are made. A token ceiling still holds, because tokens are
    counted whether or not a price was found.

class SpendCompositionWarning(UserWarning):
    """Warned when another capability is composed so that it wraps inside the accrual.

    Pydantic AI orders the `innermost` tier against non-innermost capabilities only.
    Among themselves the one listed later nests further in, so a capability listed
    after `SpendLimits` wraps inside it. Such a capability can await a response and
    then raise, which sends the run to a fresh request while the rejected response --
    generated, billed, and kept in history -- is never counted.

    This reports the ordering, not an under-count that has happened. Reaching one
    needs the nested capability to reject a response it has already awaited, and whether
    it does is its own business: an `InputGuardrail` gets there only when `parallel=True`,
    its guard blocks, and the provider answers before the guard does. Sequentially the
    guard raises before the request is made, and a parallel guard that blocks first
    cancels the call, so neither leaves anything billed to count. None of those conditions
    is read here -- `parallel` can be flipped without moving anything in the list, so the
    ordering is the durable property and the one you control. List `SpendLimits` last
    among the innermost capabilities to remove it.

    Silence it with:

    ```python
    import warnings
    from pydantic_ai_harness.spend import SpendCompositionWarning

    warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=SpendCompositionWarning)

    custom deployment) or the response carries no model name. Supply
    `SpendLimits.price` to price it yourself, or use `on_unpriced='zero'` to
    count the request as free and surface it as `Spent.unpriced_requests`.
