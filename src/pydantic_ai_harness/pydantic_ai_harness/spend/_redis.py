"""Applies one response to every window it counts against, and returns each window's totals.

KEYS is one key per entry followed by one marker key per entry; ARGV is the entry count
followed by six values per entry: the four increments, the key's horizon in seconds, and
the marker's, where a zero horizon means "keep this key" and "claim no marker".

Redis runs a script to completion without interleaving another command, so no other client
observes a response part-applied -- neither across the four counters of one window nor across
the windows themselves. Issued as separate commands instead, a failure between them leaves a
window counting some of a response and not the rest, which reads as a smaller number than was
really spent and so releases the brake later than it should.

The totals come back as bulk strings, read with `HMGET` after the increments rather than taken
from what `HINCRBY` returns. `HINCRBY` is exact 64-bit integer arithmetic and the increment
arrives as a string, so the stored counter never rounds; its *reply* is an integer that becomes
a Lua number, and Lua 5.1 numbers are doubles, so a total past 2**53 would come back rounded
even though Redis holds it exactly. A Lua string is returned as a bulk string with no double in
the path.

What is left is `HINCRBY`'s own range: a counter passing the signed 64-bit range, around $9.22
billion or 9.2 quintillion tokens against a single key, which Redis refuses before writing that
field. It aborts the script there, and Redis does not roll back what earlier commands in the
script already did, so a multi-window response would keep the windows applied before the one
that overflowed.

A per-entry marker is how an entry carrying a `SpendEntry.token` is applied at most once: the
marker is read before the increments and written after them, rather than claimed with a single
`SET ... NX` up front. Up front, an increment that overflowed would abort the script with the
marker already committed, and the retry that could have completed the window would be skipped
as a replay instead. Read-then-write is safe here without `NX` because Redis runs the whole
script without interleaving another client's commands.

A zero `ttl` means "keep this key", and says so with `PERSIST` rather than by doing nothing.
`HINCRBY` leaves an existing expiry in place, so a budget moved from a finite `retain` to
`'forever'` would otherwise keep expiring on the old horizon -- handing back the ceiling on a
schedule nothing in the configuration mentions any more, and diverging from
`InMemorySpendStore`, which drops the expiry on the next write.
