# Code Mode

Replace individual tool calls with a single sandboxed Python execution environment.

[Source](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/tree/main/src/pydantic_ai_harness/pydantic_ai_harness/code_mode/)

## The problem

Standard tool calling often needs another model turn for each dependent batch of tool calls. An agent
that needs to fetch 10 items and then process their results can require many model turns, increasing
latency, cost, and context use.

## The solution

`CodeMode` wraps eligible tools into a single `run_code` tool. The model writes orchestration code
with loops, conditionals, variables, and `asyncio.gather` inside a sandboxed
[Monty](https://github.com/pydantic/monty) runtime. Calls from that code are dispatched through
Pydantic AI to the host tools.

| Standard tool calling | Code mode |
|---|---|
| Dependent tool batches across model turns | Many dependent calls in one `run_code` |
| Parallel only when the model emits a batch | Parallelism expressed in Python |
| No local computation | Filter, transform, aggregate in code |
| Large conversation history | Compact -- fewer messages |

Durable execution integrations can record nested calls for deterministic replay.

## Usage

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[CodeMode()])

@agent.tool_plain
def get_weather(city: str) -> dict:
    """Get current weather for a city."""
    return {'city': city, 'temp_f': 72, 'condition': 'sunny'}

result = agent.run_sync("What's the weather in Paris and Tokyo, in Celsius?")
print(result.output)
```

The model writes code like:

```python
import asyncio

paris, tokyo = await asyncio.gather(
    get_weather(city='Paris'),
    get_weather(city='Tokyo'),
)
paris_c = round((paris['temp_f'] - 32) * 5 / 9, 1)
tokyo_c = round((tokyo['temp_f'] - 32) * 5 / 9, 1)
{'paris': paris_c, 'tokyo': tokyo_c}
```

## In practice

The [harness Quick start](../../README.md#quick-start) wires `CodeMode` up against an MCP server and a web search and asks it to find the most-discussed Hacker News story across three feeds, pull the comment thread and the submitter's profile, and search the web for follow-up coverage. CodeMode collapses that into two `run_code` calls: the first fetches all three feeds in parallel via `asyncio.gather`, dedupes by id, filters by score, and ranks by comment count -- in plain Python; the second batches the three follow-up calls (`hn_get_thread`, `hn_get_user`, `duckduckgo_search`) together.

See the [Pydantic AI Logfire docs](https://ai.pydantic.dev/logfire/) for setup details.

## Installation

Code mode requires the Monty sandbox:

uv:

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-harness[codemode]"
```

pip:

```bash
pip install "pydantic-ai-harness[codemode]"
```

The `code-mode` extra is also supported as an alias.

## Selective tool sandboxing

By default, `CodeMode(tools='all')` sandboxes every eligible regular tool. Framework control tools,
undiscovered deferred tools, native fallbacks, and other code-execution tools remain native. Shell
surfaces count as code-execution tools: `Shell`'s `run_command` and `start_command` sit beside `run_code` rather than inside it, so the model never has
to quote a shell command inside a generated Python string. `CapabilityCreation`'s
`author_capability` stays native for the same reason: its argument is a complete Python module.
Their non-command tools (`read_file`, `check_command`, and so on) are folded into `run_code` like
any other tool. You can control which eligible tools go through the sandbox:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

# By name -- only these tools are available inside run_code
CodeMode(tools=['search', 'fetch'])

# By predicate
CodeMode(tools=lambda ctx, td: td.name != 'dangerous_tool')

# By metadata -- combine with SetToolMetadata or .with_metadata()
CodeMode(tools={'code_mode': True})
```

Tools that match the selector are wrapped inside `run_code`. Non-matching tools remain available as regular tool calls.

### Tool Search

When you mark tools or whole toolsets `defer_loading=True` ([Tool Search](https://ai.pydantic.dev/tools-advanced/#tool-search)), `CodeMode` keeps them out of `run_code` while they're undiscovered -- they pass straight through, so Tool Search drives them as usual (sent on the wire with `defer_loading` on providers with native tool search; otherwise dropped until discovered, with a `search_tools` tool alongside `run_code`). `CodeMode` uses `RunContext.is_tool_available` to follow that reveal state. Once the model discovers a tool -- or loads the deferred capability that owns it -- `CodeMode` folds it into `run_code` like any other tool from then on, so it's callable from generated code. (The tool keeps `defer_loading=True`, which records what its author asked for; what changes is its availability for the run.)

That fold-in grows `run_code`'s description, which invalidates the prompt-cache prefix once at the moment of discovery (turns with no discovery stay cache-warm). Two ways to avoid the bust:

- Pass `dynamic_catalog=True` to keep `run_code.description` static across discoveries -- the catalog of sandboxed-tool signatures moves into agent instructions (as a dynamic [`InstructionPart`](https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.InstructionPart)) and newly-discovered tools are announced via [`ctx.enqueue`](https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.enqueue) instead of by rebuilding the description:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

CodeMode(dynamic_catalog=True)
```

  This pays off when paired with Tool Search: the tool-definitions block stays byte-stable so the prefix cache survives discoveries, at the cost of a larger (but cache-friendly) system prompt. With a fixed toolset and no Tool Search, the default keeps the system prompt shorter and is the better choice.

- To instead keep a Tool Search corpus fully native -- never folded into `run_code`, but not callable from inside it -- exclude it with a `tools` selector; corpus members carry `with_native` set to the managing native tool:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

CodeMode(tools=lambda ctx, td: td.with_native is None)
```


### Metadata-based selection

Use metadata when the decision should travel with a tool or toolset, rather than
with one `CodeMode` instance. This is useful for shared toolsets: the toolset
author can tag the tools that are safe and useful to call from generated code,
and each agent can opt into that tag with `CodeMode(tools={...})`.

`CodeMode(tools={'code_mode': True})` uses the standard Pydantic AI
`ToolSelector` metadata form. A tool is sandboxed when its
`ToolDefinition.metadata` contains all of the selector's key-value pairs. Extra
metadata on the tool is fine, and nested dictionaries are matched by deep
inclusion.

The common pattern is to tag an entire toolset with `.with_metadata(...)`:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.toolsets import FunctionToolset
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode


def search(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the web."""
    return f'results for {query}'


def fetch(url: str) -> str:
    """Fetch a URL."""
    return f'contents of {url}'


search_tools = FunctionToolset(tools=[search, fetch]).with_metadata(code_mode=True)

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
    toolsets=[search_tools],
    capabilities=[CodeMode(tools={'code_mode': True})],
)
```

Here `search` and `fetch` are removed from the model-facing tool list and
become callable functions inside `run_code`. Tools without
`metadata['code_mode'] == True` stay visible as regular tool calls.

## Return values

The last expression in the code snippet is automatically captured as the return value -- the model does not need to `print()`. An assignment stores a value in the REPL but does not return it. A final expression that evaluates to `None` is also treated as no result. Without a non-`None` final expression or print output, `run_code` returns `{}`. Put the assigned name on the final line:

```python
result = await get_weather(city='Paris')
result
```

| Scenario | Return |
|---|---|
| Non-`None` final expression with no print output | Last expression value |
| Final assignment or `None` result with no print output | `{}` |
| Print output with no final expression or a `None` result | `{"output": "<printed text>"}` |
| Print output with a plain, non-`None` final expression | `{"output": "<printed text>", "result": <last expression>}` |
| Multimodal final expression with no print output | Returned natively for model processing |
| Print output with a multimodal final expression | List with printed text followed by native multimodal content |

Printed output is limited to 10 MiB. Exceeding the limit makes `run_code` return a model retry.

Sandbox execution is bounded by `resource_limits`, which defaults to 30 seconds of execution time
and a 256 MiB heap. `max_duration_secs` applies to each `run_code` snippet: each snippet gets at most that much
sandbox time, which is what stops a runaway loop. Time spent awaiting a nested tool is
excluded. A snippet that hits the limit is stopped and its session is reset, so any variables,
imports, and definitions have to be recreated. The retry `run_code` returns says so and reports the
nested calls the snippet already made.

Sleeping is not execution time, so it has its own allowance of the same length: a snippet may sleep
for at most `max_duration_secs` in total. A sleep that would go past it raises `TimeoutError` in the
sandbox without waiting, and the session is kept. The allowance still applies inside a Temporal
workflow, where the execution-time limit is off; only `resource_limits='unlimited'` removes it.

Monty also limits cumulative suspensions with `max_suspensions` (default 1,000 per session).
External calls, OS callbacks, name lookups and future resolutions each consume this budget, so
it is not a tool-call count. Consecutive snippets share it. After exhaustion, further host
interactions fail, although pure Python using existing state may still work. `run_code` includes
the started-call summary and explicit restart guidance: inspect partial results before continuing,
since `restart: true` discards REPL state and replaying completed calls repeats their side effects.
There is no automatic restart or replay for exhaustion.

Nested tool calls are bounded separately by `max_tool_calls`, which defaults to 100 per `run_code`
call. The budget is reserved before each call is scheduled, so a snippet cannot dispatch more work
than it allows. A call past the budget fails at its call site inside the sandbox. A snippet that
catches the error keeps the results of the calls that already completed and can return them. A
snippet that lets it propagate gets a model retry reporting how many nested calls started,
followed by per-call detail: what each was called with, and whether it returned, did not finish, or was
denied. Calls that did not finish are included rather than filtered out, since a tool can apply a change
before it stops. That detail is bounded -- arguments and results are previewed, and the list stops
at a size cap and says how many entries it left out -- so a large payload cannot inflate the
retry. The reported total stays exact whether or not the list was cut, which is what tells the
model some calls are missing from what it can see. The list is context for the model, not a guard:
nothing stops it from calling those tools again, so treat it as informing the next attempt rather
than preventing a repeat.

Override them with `resource_limits={'max_duration_secs': 10, 'max_memory': 134_217_728, 'max_suspensions': 10_000}` and
`max_tool_calls=25`. Pass `resource_limits='unlimited'` only when another execution boundary
supplies equivalent limits. It removes the time and memory caps, but leaves Monty's default
suspension budget in place; suspensions cannot be unlimited.

When `CodeMode` runs inside a Temporal workflow, it disables `max_duration_secs`, including an
explicit override. `run_code` is replayed in workflow code, so measuring elapsed time there could
make replay choose a different path from the recorded workflow. The memory and suspension caps still apply. Put
time-bounded work behind a Temporal activity instead.

## REPL state

State persists between `run_code` calls within the same agent run -- variables, imports, and function definitions carry over. Pass `restart: true` in the tool call to reset state. If a worker crash or host-side execution failure invalidates the session, `run_code` returns a model retry that reports the reset and the nested calls that already started; the next snippet must recreate any required state.

## Eager execution

Normally, `CodeMode` waits for the model to finish writing a `run_code` call before it
runs any code. Set `eager=True` to start sooner:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.6-sol',
    capabilities=[CodeMode(eager=True)],
)
```

For example, suppose the model produces this code one line at a time:

```python
first = await fetch_item(item_id=1)
second = await fetch_item(item_id=2)
[first, second]
```

With eager mode, the first call to `fetch_item` can begin as soon as the first line is
complete. `CodeMode` continues receiving the remaining lines at the same time. Without
eager mode, neither call begins until the model has produced the whole snippet.

The code still counts as one `run_code` call. It uses one REPL session, one tool-call limit,
and one combined result. Hooks on `fetch_item` and other tools called by the code still run.
Hooks around `run_code` itself run only after the model has finished writing the call, so
they cannot approve or change lines that eager mode has already run.

Configured Monty resource limits still apply, but `max_duration_secs` and the sleep allowance
count per fragment: each eager fragment and the remaining code get their own, so an eager
call can run longer in total than the same code without eager mode. Memory is shared by the
session.

Keep these limitations in mind:

- Eager mode cannot undo side effects from code that has already run.
- If the model later requests `restart: true`, some work may run again.
- If the model changes an earlier line while streaming, `CodeMode` resets the REPL and asks
  the model to send the code again.
- Eager mode trusts that the provider preserves the streamed `run_code` part and its tool
  name. If a provider removes or renames the part, the work that already ran cannot be
  undone.
- Eager execution is used only when `run_code` is the first tool call in a model response.
  Later tool calls wait for normal dispatch so they run in the order the model requested.
- Eager mode is disabled when using durable execution such as Temporal or DBOS.
- Eager mode needs asyncio, like the rest of the sandbox executor.
- If a statement is interrupted before it finishes, for example because the call failed
  validation, the session restarts and the next snippet must recreate its state.
- Nested tools called from eager statements must cooperate with asyncio cancellation. When
  a run ends or a streamed call is invalidated, `CodeMode` cancels the in-flight work and
  waits a bounded time (currently 5 seconds) for it to release. Work that does not release
  in time is abandoned; it cannot start further tool calls.
- Tools called from statements that ran early are traced before the `run_code` span opens.

## Speculative execution

`speculate` starts side-effect-free tool calls while the model is still writing the
`run_code` call. As the `code` argument streams in, `CodeMode` looks for calls to the named
tools whose arguments are all keyword literals. Each one starts once the line that completes
it has streamed, even if the statement around it (an `if` arm, a `with` body) is not finished
yet. When the completed snippet runs and reaches the same call, it takes the result that is
already in flight instead of starting the tool cold. This overlaps tool latency with
model generation (speculative programmatic tool calling,
<https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2026/spec-ptc/>).

### Choose tools that are safe to run early

A speculated call can run for a branch the snippet never takes. Read-only is necessary but
not sufficient: reading changing state earlier can produce a different answer. Choose tools
whose results and external interactions are acceptable at launch time, even if never used.
Unused requests can still incur API charges, consume rate limits, and send arguments to an
external service. Cancellation does not undo a request that has already been sent.

This example registers two independent lookups over fixed data. Running it requires provider
credentials, such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Real network lookups offer more opportunity to overlap
latency than these local functions.

```python {names="defined"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode


def lookup_author(*, title: str) -> str:
    """Find a book's author in a fixed catalog."""
    return {'Frankenstein': 'Mary Shelley'}.get(title, 'Unknown')


def lookup_year(*, title: str) -> int | None:
    """Find a book's publication year in a fixed catalog."""
    return {'Frankenstein': 1818}.get(title)


code_mode = CodeMode(speculate=['lookup_author', 'lookup_year'])
agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.6-sol',
    capabilities=[code_mode],
    tools=[lookup_author, lookup_year],
)
result = agent.run_sync(
    'Use run_code to look up the author and publication year of Frankenstein. '
    'Call both tools independently with the literal keyword argument title="Frankenstein".'
)
print(result.output)
print(code_mode.speculation_stats)
```

The model chooses the snippet, so the prompt does not guarantee speculative launches.
Calls the snippet never claims are cancelled when the snippet finishes successfully. A snippet that fails before it
runs (a syntax or type error) keeps its launches so the retry can claim them; whatever the
retry leaves unclaimed is cancelled when the following model step starts.

Instead of naming tools, pass `speculate='declared'` to trust what the tools say about
themselves: tools marked `Tool(..., metadata={'read_only': True})`, and MCP tools whose
server publishes the `readOnlyHint` annotation. Idempotence is not enough, an idempotent
delete still deletes, so `idempotent` declarations do not count. A declaration is the tool
author's claim, not a proof, so `'declared'` extends the same trust to authors that an
explicit list places in you.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent, Tool
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode


def search(query: str) -> str:
    """Look something up."""
    return f'results for {query}'


agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.6-sol',
    capabilities=[CodeMode(speculate='declared')],
    tools=[Tool(search, metadata={'read_only': True})],
)
```

### Understand execution order

At snippet execution, Code Mode also scans for eligible literal calls not already in flight,
subject to the launch limit and ordering barriers. Those calls can overlap instead of waiting
for each `await` in turn. Eligible calls in both arms of an `if`/`else` can start; the taken
arm claims its result and the other launch is discarded.

Lookahead stops at a known tool call that is not eligible, including a `sequential` tool.
For example, if `update_record` is not eligible and `search` is eligible:

```python {test="skip"}
await update_record(key='status', value='ready')
await search(query='status')  # Runs after the update, not speculatively ahead of it.
```

To overlap an earlier blocking read with later calls, that read must also be eligible.
Streamed `run_code` parts following another model tool call wait for normal dispatch.
Eligibility is a trust decision, not an analysis of arbitrary Python side effects.

Keep these limitations in mind:

- Only calls with literal keyword arguments can start early. A call whose argument comes
  from an earlier statement waits for that statement.
- Calls are found in the streamed text, so a call spelled inside a string literal or a
  comment can start too. It is discarded when the snippet finishes.
- `sequential` tools never speculate, and nothing speculates when the run's parallel
  execution mode is `sequential`.
- Hooks on a speculated tool run when it starts, not when the snippet claims it. Hooks,
  approval, and guardrails on `run_code` itself run only after the model has finished writing
  the call, so they cannot stop a call that has already started early; this is the same
  contract as eager mode.
- At most `max_tool_calls` calls (and never more than 32) start early per `run_code` call;
  later ones run cold. This speculative allowance is separate from the snippet's dispatch
  budget: unclaimed launches are extra work, not a reservation against `max_tool_calls`.
- Speculated tools must cooperate with asyncio cancellation. Cleanup requests cancellation
  and waits up to five seconds per streamed call, then stops waiting. A tool that suppresses
  cancellation can outlive the run; this timeout does not forcibly stop its work.
- Enabling `speculate` puts runs in streaming mode, and the option is disabled under durable
  execution such as Temporal or DBOS.

`speculate` composes with `eager=True`: eager execution runs the statements the model has
finished writing, and speculation starts the calls it has not reached yet (branch arms, calls
after a slow statement). Statements that eager mode runs claim those launches too.

### Check whether speculation helps

`CodeMode.speculation_stats` is `None` when speculation is disabled. When enabled, its counters
accumulate across runs using that capability instance; take before/after snapshots for a
per-run comparison. Successful `run_code` returns can also carry a `speculation` entry in
history-only metadata, alongside `tool_calls` and `tool_returns`. Model-visible content is unchanged.

| Metric | Scope | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `launched` | Capability instance | Calls started speculatively, during streaming or execution. |
| `adopted` | Capability instance | Speculative outcomes consumed by actual dispatches, including tool errors. |
| `evicted` | Capability instance | Unclaimed launches discarded or sent a cancellation request. |
| `hits` | `run_code` return | Dispatches that consumed a speculative outcome. |
| `misses` | `run_code` return | Dispatches to eligible tools that found no matching launch and ran normally. |
| `wasted` | `run_code` return | Unclaimed launches discarded at this call's successful completion. |
| `hidden_ms` | `run_code` return | Sum of launch-to-settlement durations for adopted calls. |

`hidden_ms` is **not measured end-to-end time saved**: calls can overlap, and it includes time
spent waiting for a launch that was still running when claimed. Compare total run latency and
external request cost with speculation on and off. Neither `evicted` nor `wasted` proves that
an unused call completed, stopped, or avoided its cost.

The lifecycle is also emitted as
[capability events](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/core-concepts/hooks/) in the `code_mode`
namespace, so UIs and other capabilities can follow it live from the run's event stream:
`SpeculativeCodeUpdateEvent` (the decoded snippet so far, with its closed-statement
boundary), `SpeculativeCallLaunchedEvent` (with the launching statement's line span and a
`phase` of `streaming` or `execution`), `SpeculativeCallSettledEvent` (only while the stream
is still flowing; a call that finishes later reports its state on its claimed or evicted
event instead), and, once the snippet runs, `SpeculativeCallClaimedEvent`,
`SpeculativeCallMissedEvent`, and `SpeculativeCallEvictedEvent`.

### Why isn't a call speculating?

- Is the tool registered and exposed inside `run_code`, rather than kept native?
- Is its original tool name allowlisted, or does it carry a trusted read-only declaration?
- Does the generated call use literal keyword arguments rather than variables or positional arguments?
- Does an earlier non-eligible tool call block lookahead, or an earlier model tool call defer it?
- Is the tool marked `sequential`, or is the run using global sequential execution?
- Is durable execution active, or has the per-call speculative launch limit been reached?

If these checks pass, inspect the generated code and launch events. Oversized streamed arguments
and exhausted parser-work budgets also stop stream scanning; speculation is an optimization,
not a guarantee that every eligible call starts early.

## Remote workers over WebSockets

Set `monty_sandbox_url` to run sandboxed code on a remote Monty worker instead of a local
subprocess:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
    capabilities=[CodeMode(monty_sandbox_url='wss://sandbox.example.com/monty')],
)
```

The URL points to a server that connects each WebSocket to one Monty worker, such as
[Full Monty](https://pydantic.dev/docs/monty/commercial-support/server/). Use `wss://` unless the
server is on a network you trust. The connection carries the tool calls your agent executes and
their results, so anyone who can intercept it can choose what your tools run.

Only code execution moves to the worker. Your tools, `mount` directories, `os_access`, and `print`
output are still handled by the agent's process, and REPL state persists across `run_code` calls
as it does locally. Eager execution, speculation, resource limits, and Temporal work the same way.
The connection gives up when the worker has not answered within `max_duration_secs` plus 10 seconds,
counted from each point the snippet starts or resumes after a tool call.
With no duration limit (`resource_limits='unlimited'`, or inside a Temporal workflow), a server
that stops responding is waited on indefinitely.

## Temporal durability

Install both integrations:

uv:

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-harness[codemode,temporal]"
```

pip:

```bash
pip install "pydantic-ai-harness[codemode,temporal]"
```

Construct the named agent and its stable-ID toolsets outside the workflow, then attach
`TemporalDurability` alongside `CodeMode`:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.durable_exec.temporal import TemporalDurability
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.6-sol',
    name='coding-agent',
    capabilities=[CodeMode(), TemporalDurability()],
)
```

Follow the [Pydantic AI Temporal guide](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/capabilities/durable_execution/temporal/)
to call the plain agent from a workflow and register its activities with `PydanticAIPlugin` and
either `__pydantic_ai_agents__` or `AgentPlugin`.

`PydanticAIPlugin` passes `pydantic_monty` through Temporal's workflow sandbox. This makes Monty
runnable there, but `run_code` still executes in workflow code and is re-executed during replay.
This works with local workers and with `monty_sandbox_url`. With a remote worker, replay connects
to the worker again, so it must be reachable whenever the workflow replays.
Model requests and, by default, nested tool calls cross Temporal activity boundaries;
`asyncio.gather` can schedule nested tool activities concurrently. The REPL is process-local state
for one agent run, not durable storage. Replay reconstructs it by running the recorded snippets
again against recorded activity results.

Keep workflow-side code deterministic. `mount` reads and writes, `os_access` callbacks, and
host-clock calls happen again during replay; changing their results can change which activities the
workflow schedules and cause a `NondeterminismError`. Put external reads, writes, clock access, and
other side effects in wrapped tools so Temporal records them as activities. Replay may not flag
changed arguments when the same activity remains at the same history position, so replay validation
is not a substitute for this boundary. Temporal activity timeouts apply to nested tools, not pure
computation inside `run_code`. The workflow waits while the sandbox computes, and Temporal fails a
workflow task that does not yield within 2 seconds, so move heavier computation into a tool.
Clock, environment, and randomness calls reach `os_access` on the workflow's own thread, so a
handler can answer `datetime.now()` with `workflow.now()` and stay replay-safe. File calls are
answered by Monty from the mounts first and reach the handler on another thread.

## Observability

Nested tool calls inside `run_code` produce their own spans when instrumented with [Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) or any OpenTelemetry backend. The `run_code` tool return includes metadata with all nested calls:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.messages import ToolReturnPart
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[CodeMode()])


@agent.tool_plain
def get_weather(city: str) -> dict:
    """Get current weather for a city."""
    return {'city': city, 'temp_f': 72}


result = agent.run_sync("What's the weather in Paris?")

for msg in result.all_messages():
    for part in msg.parts:
        if isinstance(part, ToolReturnPart) and part.tool_name == 'run_code':
            metadata = part.metadata or {}
            tool_calls = metadata['tool_calls']      # dict[str, ToolCallPart]
            tool_returns = metadata['tool_returns']  # dict[str, ToolReturnPart]
```

## Filesystem and OS access

Sandboxed code starts with no access to the host's files, environment, or clock. Two parameters add
controlled filesystem, environment, or clock behavior.

**`mount` -- share host directories.** Reach for this when the agent works with real files: analyzing
a dataset you've dropped in a folder and writing a report back, editing a checkout, or processing a
batch of documents. Sandboxed `pathlib` code reads and writes under the mounted path. (For
environment variables or the clock, use `os_access` instead.)

Mounts are directories on the machine running the agent, not the run's workspace. With a remote
sandbox such as `ModalSandbox`, `Shell` and `FileSystem` act in the sandbox while mounted `pathlib`
code still reads and writes the host. Use the workspace tools for files the model shares with its
commands.

```python
from pydantic_monty import MountDir

from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

# The agent can read /work/data.csv and write /work/summary.md back to the host:
CodeMode(mount=MountDir(virtual_path='/work', host_path='/tmp/agent-workspace', mode='read-write'))
```

**`os_access` -- answer the sandbox's OS calls yourself.** Reach for this when the agent needs
environment variables, the current date and time, or filesystem behavior you control. Hand it a
ready-made OS implementation, or a callback that decides each call -- so you can inject just the
secrets it needs, pin "now" for reproducible runs, or route file access to your own store.

```python
from pydantic_monty import NOT_HANDLED, OSAccess

from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

# Give the agent a fixed set of environment values:
CodeMode(os_access=OSAccess(environ={'API_BASE': 'https://api.example.com'}))


# ...or intercept each call to decide what the agent may see:
allowed_env = {'API_KEY': 'sk-...'}


def my_os(*, name, args, kwargs, **_):
    if name == 'os.getenv':
        # Answer the call: allow-listed keys resolve, every other key reads back
        # as None -- absent, exactly like a real unset variable.
        return allowed_env.get(args[0])
    # Refuse everything else: NOT_HANDLED makes the call fail in the sandbox.
    return NOT_HANDLED


CodeMode(os_access=my_os)
```

The callback takes keyword arguments and may be `async`. The older positional form, `my_os(name, args, kwargs)`,
still works but is deprecated and will be removed in the next breaking release.

Your callback's return value decides the call's fate, and the two outcomes are easy to confuse:

- **Return any value** -- including `None`, `''`, or `0` -- and that becomes the result the sandbox
  sees. `os.getenv` returning `None` looks exactly like a normal unset variable, so the agent's code
  keeps running. This is how you *hide* something: answer with an empty value.
- **Return `NOT_HANDLED`** and the call is treated as unsupported: it raises inside the sandbox and
  the model gets a retry. This *refuses* a capability outright -- use it to block, not to say "no
  value". Returning `NOT_HANDLED` for a key the agent reasonably expects will burn retries.

`mount` exposes the selected host directories. The built-in `OSAccess` uses an isolated in-memory
filesystem and environment but the host clock by default; a custom handler or `CallbackFile` can
expose other host resources. Access is fixed when the capability is built, so construct `CodeMode`
per request to scope it.

A `MountDir` defaults to copy-on-write `mode='overlay'`: the sandbox reads host files and sees writes
made during the current `run_code` call, but Monty discards those writes before the next call and they
do **not** reach the host. Pass `mode='read-write'` when later calls need to read the writes, or
`mode='read-only'` to forbid writes.

> Monty-specific: these parameters use Monty's `AbstractOS`/`MountDir` types.

## Sandbox restrictions

Code runs inside [Monty](https://github.com/pydantic/monty), a sandboxed Python subset. Key restrictions:

- No third-party imports (allowed stdlib: `sys`, `typing`, `asyncio`, `math`, `json`, `re`,
  `unicodedata`, `datetime`, `time`, `random`, `os`, `pathlib`)
- `asyncio.gather(...)` accepts positional awaitables but no keyword arguments; other task creation
  and wait APIs are unavailable
- No clock or randomness by default (`datetime.datetime.now()`, `datetime.date.today()`, `time.time()`, unseeded `random`) -- they become available when an `os_access` handler implements them (the built-in `OSAccess` does); `time.sleep` and `asyncio.sleep` really wait, up to the allowance described under resource limits; inside a Temporal workflow a sleep is a durable timer
- No `import *`
- Filesystem I/O needs an `os_access` handler or a `mount`; `os.getenv`/`os.environ` need an `os_access` handler
- Tools requiring approval or with deferred (`CallDeferred`) execution are sandboxed like any other tool; without a `HandleDeferredToolCalls` (or equivalent) capability on the agent to resolve them inline, calling one from `run_code` raises an error that surfaces to the model as a retry
- Tool results reach the sandbox in the JSON shape their generated stub declares, since the stub is derived from the tool's JSON schema: `Decimal`, `UUID` and `datetime` arrive as strings, and mapping keys are stringified, so a `dict[int, str]` of `{1: 'a'}` arrives as `{'1': 'a'}`. `bytes` and `bytearray` are the exception: Monty carries binary natively, so they cross unchanged even though the stub declares `str` for them
- A tool without a return schema is still callable, but its generated signature shows `-> Any`, so the model has to guess the result's shape. `CodeMode` names such tools in one `CodeModeReturnSchemaWarning` (a `UserWarning` subclass) per run. Give a function tool a return annotation, or have your MCP server declare an `outputSchema`; when the server is not yours, silence just this category with `warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=CodeModeReturnSchemaWarning)`

## API

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

CodeMode(
    tools='all',          # 'all', list[str], callable, or metadata dict
    max_retries=3,        # retries on sandbox execution errors
    max_tool_calls=100,   # nested tool calls allowed in one run_code call
    id=None,              # required when defer_loading=True
    description=None,     # one-line catalog entry shown while deferred
    defer_loading=False,
    os_access=None,       # OS behavior; custom handlers may expose host resources
    mount=None,           # host directories to share with the sandbox
    resource_limits=None, # sandbox time and memory caps; 'unlimited' removes them
    monty_sandbox_url=None, # ws:// or wss:// URL of a remote Monty worker server
    dynamic_catalog=False,
)
```

## Agent spec (YAML/JSON)

CodeMode works with Pydantic AI's [agent spec](https://ai.pydantic.dev/agent-spec/) feature for defining agents in YAML:

```yaml
# agent.yaml
model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6
capabilities:
  - CodeMode: {}
```

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

agent = Agent.from_file('agent.yaml', custom_capability_types=[CodeMode])
result = agent.run_sync('...')
print(result.output)
```

Pass `custom_capability_types` so the spec loader knows how to instantiate `CodeMode`. You can also pass arguments in the YAML:

```yaml
capabilities:
  - CodeMode:
      tools: ['search', 'fetch']
      max_retries: 5
```
