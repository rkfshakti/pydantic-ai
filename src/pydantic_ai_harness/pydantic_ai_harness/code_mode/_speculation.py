"""Speculative launch of sandboxed tool calls while `run_code` arguments stream.

Implements the streaming half of speculative programmatic tool calling (sPTC,
<https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2026/spec-ptc/>) for `CodeMode`: while the model is still
emitting the `run_code` tool call, the partial `code` argument is decoded from the accumulated
JSON and scanned for calls to eligible sandbox functions whose arguments are all literals. Those
calls launch immediately as tasks; when the completed snippet later executes and dispatches the
same call, the in-flight task is adopted instead of starting the tool cold.

The other half of the trick, overlapping independent calls with each other during execution,
already exists: `MontyExecutor` defers external calls as futures and only forces them when the
sandbox needs the value.

Scope is deliberately the blog's "Case 1" (all-literal arguments). Calls whose arguments carry
dependencies would need a shadow interpreter to materialize values.

Only eligible tools are ever launched early. Launching early is observationally equivalent to
the normal call only for tools without side effects, so eligibility is an explicit promise: the
user's allowlist, or the tools' own declarations. Speculated calls run through the same nested
`ToolManager` path as cold calls, so tool hooks fire at launch time rather than at adoption time.
