class CodeMode(AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]):
    """Capability that exposes selected tools as callables inside a `run_code` sandbox.

    By default (`tools='all'`) every eligible regular tool the agent has is wrapped
    behind a single `run_code` tool -- the model writes Python that calls them as
    functions instead of issuing tool calls directly. Framework control tools,
    undiscovered deferred tools, native fallbacks, and other code-execution tools
    remain native.

    Pass a list of tool names or a callable predicate to `tools` to split the
    toolset: matching tools become callables inside the sandbox, and the rest
    stay visible to the model as normal tool calls.

    ```python
    from pydantic_ai import Agent
    from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

    # Sandbox all tools
    agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5', capabilities=[CodeMode()])

    # Sandbox only specific tools
    agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5', capabilities=[CodeMode(tools=['search', 'fetch'])])
    ```

    By default, sandboxed code cannot touch the host -- no filesystem, environment
    variables, or clock. Two parameters open it up:

    - `mount` shares specific host directories: reach for it when the agent reads or
      writes real files.
    - `os_access` routes the sandbox's OS calls to a handler you provide: reach for it
      when the agent needs environment variables, the clock, or filesystem behavior you
      control.

    `mount` exposes selected host directories. The built-in `OSAccess` has an
    isolated filesystem and environment but uses the host clock by default; custom
    OS handlers can expose other host resources.

    ```python
    from pydantic_monty import MountDir

    agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5', capabilities=[CodeMode(mount=MountDir(virtual_path='/work', host_path='/tmp/agent-work'))])
    ```

    handler is awaited on an event loop instead. Inside a Temporal workflow, clock, environment, and

    By default the signatures of all sandboxed tools are rendered into `run_code`'s
    description, which lives in the prompt-cache-keyed tool-definitions block. When the
    toolset changes mid-run -- e.g. [`ToolSearch`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.ToolSearch]
    reveals a new tool that then gets folded into `run_code` -- the description changes and
    busts the prefix cache from that point on.

    Set `dynamic_catalog=True` to instead:

    - keep only the static base prose (sandbox restrictions, return-value contract) in
      `run_code.description`, so the tool-definitions block stays byte-stable across
      discoveries;
    - move the "available functions" catalog (TypedDict definitions + signatures) into
      agent instructions as a dynamic
      [`InstructionPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.InstructionPart], which providers with
      static/dynamic instruction splitting (Anthropic, Bedrock) place after the cache
      breakpoint;
    - announce newly-discovered tools via a short
      [`SystemPromptPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.SystemPromptPart] enqueued through
      [`RunContext.enqueue`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.enqueue], so the model knows the
      new functions are callable without rewriting the cached description.

    This pays off when paired with [`ToolSearch`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.ToolSearch]: the
    tool-definitions cache survives discoveries at the cost of a larger (but
    cache-friendly) system prompt. With a fixed toolset and no `ToolSearch`, the default
    keeps the system prompt shorter and is the better choice.
