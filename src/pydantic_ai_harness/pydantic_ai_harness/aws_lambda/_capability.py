"""Durable execution for Pydantic AI agents on AWS Lambda durable functions.

Checkpoints an agent's I/O -- model requests, function tool calls, MCP calls, and
dynamic-toolset resolution -- into Lambda durable steps (`DurableContext.step(...)`), so an
invocation that times out, fails, or is retried resumes from the last completed step instead of
replaying the work.

Lambda's durable API is synchronous and an agent run is async, so the capability drives every
step through the bridge in `_bridge.py`. See `durable_agent_handler`, which adapts an async handler
body, and `run_durable`, the lower-level bridge entrypoint.

    """Capability that checkpoints an agent's I/O into AWS Lambda durable steps.

    Attach it with `capabilities=[AWSLambdaDurability()]` and decorate an async handler with
    `durable_agent_handler`: every model request, function tool call, MCP call, and dynamic-toolset
    resolution is wrapped in `DurableContext.step(...)`. A completed step is served from its
    checkpoint when the execution resumes, so finished work is not repeated and tokens are not
    re-spent.

    A step is checkpointed after it runs, so an interruption between a tool's side effect and its
    checkpoint re-runs the tool when the execution resumes: keep tool side effects idempotent, or
    set `step_semantics` to `AT_MOST_ONCE_PER_RETRY` for the tools that cannot tolerate it.

    Outside a durable handler the capability is transparent and the run is an ordinary agent run.

    Step results are checkpointed through the Lambda SDK's serializer, so a checkpointed tool's
    return value must survive that round trip. Control-flow signals (`ModelRetry`,
    `ApprovalRequired`, `CallDeferred`, `ToolFailed`) cross the boundary as values rather than
    exceptions, so approval and deferred-tool flows work inside a durable execution.

        ```python {test="skip"}
        from aws_durable_execution_sdk_python import DurableContext, durable_execution
        from pydantic_ai import Agent
