"""Bridge between Lambda's synchronous durable API and the async agent loop.

`DurableContext.step()` is synchronous, must be called from the handler's own thread, and
blocks until the step body returns. An agent run is async. The bridge connects them with two
threads and a queue:

- the handler thread runs `run_durable`, which drains a queue of step requests and calls
  `context.step(...)` for each one, so every step is created on the handler's thread in one
  continuous sequence;
- a background thread runs a persistent event loop that hosts the agent run and the actual
  model and tool calls.

A step body dispatched on the handler thread schedules its async operation back onto the agent
loop and blocks on the result, so the loop stays free while the handler thread waits.

The active bridge is published in a `ContextVar` rather than passed around, so the capability
does not have to be handed a `DurableContext` per invocation.

The invariant the bridge holds: **every queued step request is resolved exactly once**. The
handler thread blocks on the result of the step it is servicing, so a request that is never
resolved wedges the invocation until the function times out.
