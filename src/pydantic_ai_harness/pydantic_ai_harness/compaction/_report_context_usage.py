    """Report context usage to the application before each model request.

    A compaction strategy knows when to act but says nothing about how close the run is to
    the limit, so an application that wants to show "context: 73%" has to re-count the
    history itself and guess the denominator. This capability does neither: it reuses the
    same estimator the strategies use and the model's real context window.

    It only observes -- it never edits the history.

    Order matters: register it *after* a compaction capability to see the compacted history,
    or before it to see what triggered the compaction. After a preceding compactor rewrites
    anchored history, the reading subtracts that compactor's heuristic reclaim while retaining
    the anchor's fixed provider overhead.

        ```python
        from pydantic_ai import Agent
