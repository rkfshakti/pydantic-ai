# Researcher

`Researcher` gives a Pydantic AI agent a compact stack for broad web research with source-backed answers.
It is a regular [combined capability](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/capabilities/custom/#composition-and-middleware-semantics) made from the [capabilities](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/capabilities/overview/) below, so you can use it as-is or take it apart.

Install the local search and fetch fallbacks (DuckDuckGo search, page-to-Markdown fetching):

uv:

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-harness[researcher]"
```

pip:

```bash
pip install "pydantic-ai-harness[researcher]"
```

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import LocalWorkspace
from pydantic_ai_harness import Researcher

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.6-sol', capabilities=[LocalWorkspace('.'), Researcher()])

result = agent.run_sync('What changed in the last three major releases of Django?')
print(result.output)
```

The same agent works with every Pydantic AI interface: [`agent.to_cli_sync()`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/cli/) for terminal chat, [`agent.to_web()`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/web/) for a browser chat UI.

Or skip the file entirely and run the exported `researcher_agent` with [`clai`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/cli/#custom-agents) (the Pydantic AI CLI), via [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/):

```bash
uvx --with 'pydantic-ai-harness[researcher]' clai -a pydantic_ai_harness.researcher:researcher_agent -m openai:gpt-5.6-sol
```

It is literally these capabilities combined, in this order:

- Concise default research instructions (`DEFAULT_RESEARCHER_INSTRUCTIONS`): pass `instructions='...'` to replace them, or `instructions=None` to disable
- Core [`WebSearch(local=True)`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/capabilities/web-search/): the provider's native web search when the model supports it, with a local DuckDuckGo fallback when it doesn't
- Core [`WebFetch(local=True)`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/capabilities/web-fetch/): read the pages behind the results, native where supported with a local fallback, so claims can be checked against their sources
- [`SubAgents`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/subagents/): delegation, with a focused web `researcher` sub-agent by default
- [`ToolOutputLimits`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/tool-output-limits/): bounds how much context any single tool result can consume, spilling oversized results to files in the run's workspace

Pass `subagents=[]` to disable delegation, or supply your own `SubAgent` entries.

Oversized tool results are stored in the run's [workspace](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/core-concepts/workspace/), under `.pydantic-ai-harness/tool-output/` (git-ignored), so a run without one fails at its start. `LocalWorkspace('.')` keeps them in the current directory and a sandbox capability keeps them in the sandbox. To run without a workspace, pass `Researcher(store=LocalFileStore())`; spills then stay on the machine running the agent, including for its default delegate. A custom delegate needs its own store configured.

## Blown-out equivalent

<!-- Keep this in sync with pydantic_ai_harness/researcher; it intentionally shows the complete picture. -->

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import LocalWorkspace, WebFetch, WebSearch
from pydantic_ai_harness import SubAgent, SubAgents, ToolOutputLimits

instructions = """\
Search broadly before drawing conclusions.

"""

sub_researcher = SubAgent(
    Agent(
        name='researcher',
        description='Research a focused sub-question on the web and report back with findings and source links',
        capabilities=[WebSearch(local=True), WebFetch(local=True), ToolOutputLimits()],
    )
)

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.6-sol',
    instructions=instructions,
    capabilities=[
        LocalWorkspace('.'),  # where oversized tool results are spilled
        WebSearch(local=True),  # native provider search, DuckDuckGo fallback on models without it
        WebFetch(local=True),  # read the pages behind the results, native or local
        SubAgents(agents=[sub_researcher], agent_folders=None),
        ToolOutputLimits(),  # spills oversized results to the workspace
    ],
)
```

While Pydantic AI Harness is on 0.x releases, the API may change between minor releases; deprecation warnings and release-note migration guidance tell you (or your agent) exactly how to upgrade; see the [version policy](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/#version-policy).
