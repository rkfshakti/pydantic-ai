"""Live Redis conformance tests for `RedisSpendStore`.

The unit suite in `tests/spend` drives the store through a fake that reproduces the
result `_ADD_SCRIPT` is meant to produce. It never runs the Lua, so what it cannot
answer decides whether the store is correct:

- that the script is valid Lua the server accepts at all;
- that a total past `2**53` billionths comes back exact, which is the whole reason
  the totals are read with `HMGET` instead of taken from what `HINCRBY` returns;
- that one script applies every window of a response, each with its own horizon;
- that a counter passing the signed 64-bit range is refused before that field is
  written, rather than rounded;
- that a repeated `SpendEntry.token` claims nothing and adds nothing;
- that a zero `ttl` clears an expiry an earlier finite `retain` set, which is
  `PERSIST` doing work `HINCRBY` would not do on its own;
- that a counter written under the untagged key an earlier release used is still read
  and carried forward.

This file covers exactly those. It is not a second copy of the unit suite --
API-shape coverage belongs there, where it runs on every matrix leg.

Run against a local server with `make integration-redis` after starting one, e.g.
`docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:8`. Without a reachable server the tests skip,
unless `REDIS_REQUIRE_LIVE` is set (CI does), where an unreachable server fails
instead -- a service container that never came up must not pass as a silent skip.

External assumptions, verified 2026-08-05 against Redis 8 (`redis:8`):

- `HINCRBY` is 64-bit integer arithmetic and takes its increment as a string, so a
  stored counter is exact whatever Lua could hold; it errors with `increment or
  decrement would overflow` past the signed range, without writing. Source:
  <https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/hincrby/>.
- `HINCRBY` does not alter a key's TTL. Source:
  <https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/hincrby/>.
- `PERSIST` removes an expiry and returns 0 when the key has none, so calling it
  unconditionally on the keep-forever path is safe. Source:
  <https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/persist/>.
- `EVAL` runs the script to completion without interleaving another client's
  command, but does not roll back on a mid-script error. Source:
  <https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/programmability/eval-intro/>.
- A Lua string returned from a script becomes a bulk string, and a Lua number
  becomes an integer via a double. Source:
  <https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/programmability/lua-api/>.
