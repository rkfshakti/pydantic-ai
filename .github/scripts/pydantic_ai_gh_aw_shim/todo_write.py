"""Claude's `TodoWrite` tool -- record the agent's task checklist.

Backed by pydantic-ai-harness's `planning` capability: the adapter
maps Claude's todo schema onto the harness `PlanItem` list and renders it with
the harness's `render_plan`, the checklist its `write_plan` tool returns, with the
same advisory note when more than one step is `in_progress`. `write_plan` itself
can't be called here: it emits plan events, which only a capability-owned tool
inside an agent run may do, and `TodoWrite` is a plain tool.

The Claude `TodoWrite` signature (`content` / `status` /
`activeForm` items) is preserved; `activeForm` is the present-tense label Claude
shows while a step runs and has no harness equivalent, so it's dropped (the
headless shim renders nothing live anyway).
