# AWS Lambda Durability

`AWSLambdaDurability` makes an agent resumable on [AWS Lambda durable
functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/durable-functions.html). Every model
request, function tool call, MCP call, and dynamic-toolset resolution is checkpointed as a durable
step, so an invocation that times out, fails, or is retried continues from the last completed step
instead of repeating the work already paid for.

Lambda keeps a log of durable operations. When an execution resumes, the handler runs again from
the top and completed steps return their stored results rather than executing. Without
checkpointing, a resumed run would repeat every model request and tool call.

## Installation

```bash
pip/uv-add "pydantic-ai-harness[aws-lambda]"
```

The AWS Durable Execution SDK requires Python 3.11 or newer.

The quick start below uses a Bedrock provider model, which needs the Bedrock SDK from
`pydantic-ai-slim[bedrock]`:

```bash
pip/uv-add "pydantic-ai-harness[aws-lambda]" "pydantic-ai-slim[bedrock]"
```

## Quick start

Attach the capability when you build the agent, then adapt an async handler body with
`durable_agent_handler`:

```python {title="handler.py" test="skip" lint="skip"}
from typing import Any

from aws_durable_execution_sdk_python import DurableContext, durable_execution
from pydantic_ai import Agent

from pydantic_ai_harness.aws_lambda import AWSLambdaDurability, durable_agent_handler

agent = Agent(
    'bedrock:us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0',
    name='support',
    capabilities=[AWSLambdaDurability()],
)


@agent.tool_plain
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    return f'It is sunny in {city}.'


@durable_execution
@durable_agent_handler
async def handler(event: dict[str, Any], context: DurableContext) -> str:
    result = await agent.run(str(event['prompt']))
    return result.output
```

Attach the capability at construction rather than per run. Per-run attachment does work (the
capability binds and wraps toolsets either way), but attaching once keeps the wrapping and the
deployed step shape stable across invocations, and it matches the other durability integrations.

Deploy with a durable configuration and invoke a published version, since in-flight executions are
pinned to the version that started them:

```bash
aws lambda create-function \
  --function-name support-agent \
  --runtime python3.13 \
  --handler handler.handler \
  --role <ROLE_ARN> \
  --zip-file fileb://support-agent.zip \
  --timeout 300 --memory-size 1024 \
  --durable-config '{"ExecutionTimeout":3600,"RetentionPeriodInDays":7}'

aws lambda publish-version --function-name support-agent
```

!!! warning "A run is durable only inside the durable handler bridge"
    Attaching `AWSLambdaDurability` does not by itself make a run durable. Only a run entered through
    `durable_agent_handler` or `run_durable` is checkpointed. Calling `agent.run_sync(...)`, or
    awaiting the agent from your own `asyncio.run(...)`, produces a fully working but
    **non-durable** run, with no warning.

## Requirements

The agent needs a `name` (or `AWSLambdaDurability(name=...)`), and every leaf toolset needs a unique
`id`. Both are part of every step name, so both are checked when the agent is constructed: an agent
without a name raises a `UserError` from `Agent(...)`, as does a toolset that has no `id` or shares
one with another toolset. Tools registered directly on the agent live in a toolset whose id renders
as `<agent>`, so `@agent.tool_plain def get_weather` is checkpointed as
`{name}__function_toolset__<agent>.call_tool:get_weather`.

## How the sync handler and the async agent connect

Lambda's durable API is synchronous: `context.step(...)` blocks, and every step has to be created
on the thread Lambda invoked. An agent run is async. `durable_agent_handler` uses `run_durable` to
bridge the two: it hosts the async handler body on a background event loop and services its steps
on the Lambda handler thread, so all steps are created in one continuous sequence. A step body
hands its work back to the agent loop and blocks until it finishes, which keeps the loop free while
the handler thread waits.

The async body can await two agent runs, use `asyncio.gather`, or perform async post-processing
between runs, and all of those sections share the same bridge and step sequence. A synchronous
handler must call `run_durable` separately for each async section, and concurrent calls are
rejected.

Three consequences are worth knowing:

- `@durable_execution` must be the outermost decorator because its wrapper is what Lambda invokes.
  Reversing the order raises a `UserError` when the handler is defined.
- `run_durable` blocks the calling thread, so it cannot be called from inside a running event loop.
  Call it directly from a synchronous handler. It remains available when the bridge needs to be
  entered somewhere other than the top of a handler.
- Durable steps cannot nest. A tool that starts another durable agent run is rejected with an
  explanatory error rather than deadlocking.

The loop is reused across invocations of a warm execution environment, so loop-bound resources like
a provider's cached HTTP client stay valid between them. A run abandoned by a suspension or an error
is therefore cancelled before the handler returns, and `run_durable` waits `cancel_timeout` seconds
(5 by default) for it to unwind. Raise that for a workload whose cleanup is genuinely slow. If the
timeout expires, the abandoned cleanup keeps running on a retired loop for at most the retired
loop's grace period and can overlap the next warm invocation. Do not share mutable module-global
state between the agent run and the handler. An external side effect from cleanup, such as writing
to a store, releasing a shared lock, or emitting a metric, can also land during a later invocation.
Loop-bound resources are isolated: the next invocation gets a fresh loop, so the abandoned cleanup
cannot touch resources such as that invocation's provider HTTP client.

Loop reuse has one more consequence: do not detach background work from a tool with
`asyncio.create_task()` or by leaving executor work unawaited. Detached work is not checkpointed and
is not covered by durable execution's guarantees, and it can outlive the invocation that started it.

## What gets checkpointed

Step names are built from the agent's `name` and each toolset's `id`:

| Step name | Operation |
|---|---|
| `{name}__model.request` | one model request segment |
| `{name}__model.request_stream` | one streamed model request segment |
| `{name}__model.compact_messages` | one model message-compaction operation |
| `{name}__model.cancel_suspended_response` | tearing down a suspended response |
| `{name}__capability__{capability_id}.{operation}` | an operation contributed by another capability |
| `{name}__function_toolset__{id}.validate_args` | validating a function tool call's arguments |
| `{name}__function_toolset__{id}.call_tool:{tool}` | a function tool call |
| `{name}__mcp_server__{id}.get_tools` | listing an MCP server's tools |
| `{name}__mcp_server__{id}.get_instructions` | an MCP server's instructions |
| `{name}__mcp_server__{id}.call_tool` | an MCP tool call |
| `{name}__dynamic_toolset__{id}.get_tools` | resolving a dynamic toolset |
| `{name}__dynamic_toolset__{id}.validate_args` | validating a dynamic toolset call's arguments |
| `{name}__dynamic_toolset__{id}.call_tool:{tool}` | a dynamic toolset's tool call |
| `{name}__event_stream_handler` | one event delivered to an `event_stream_handler` |

A model operation that does not use the agent's default model records its model id in the step name
(for example, `{name}__model.request.{model_id}`), so a resumed execution maps each checkpoint back
to the model it was recorded for. The default model keeps the plain, suffix-less name.

## Constraints

- **Steps are at least once, and retried by default.** A step is checkpointed after it runs, so an
  interruption between a tool's side effect and its checkpoint re-runs the tool when the execution
  resumes. On top of that, the SDK's default retry policy is six attempts with exponential backoff
  (5s to 60s), applied to every model request and every tool call. Keep tool side effects
  idempotent. `AT_MOST_ONCE_PER_RETRY` alone is not enough to make a tool run once: it prevents
  re-execution after an interruption *within* an attempt, but the retry policy still starts further
  attempts that do execute the body. For a tool that must not repeat, set both:

    ```python {names="defined"}
    from aws_durable_execution_sdk_python.config import StepSemantics
    from aws_durable_execution_sdk_python.retries import RetryPresets

    metadata={'aws_lambda': {'step_semantics': StepSemantics.AT_MOST_ONCE_PER_RETRY,
                             'retry_strategy': RetryPresets.none()}}
    ```

- **Retries stack.** Pydantic AI and provider clients have their own retry logic. Leaving those
  enabled alongside the step retry policy multiplies the attempts and mishandles `Retry-After`;
  disable one side.
- **Tool calls run one at a time.** A step's identity comes from the order steps are reached, so
  concurrently scheduled tool calls could claim each other's checkpoints when the execution
  resumes. Inside a durable handler the run is switched to sequential tool execution. Outside one
  the agent keeps its configured parallelism.
- **Changing the shape of the run breaks in-flight executions.** A resumed execution matches
  checkpoints by the order operations are reached, so anything that changes the number or order of
  steps breaks executions started under the old code: adding or removing a tool or MCP server,
  flipping a `metadata={'aws_lambda': False}` opt-out, adding an `event_stream_handler` (which
  switches the model step to `model.request_stream` and adds handler steps), or changing the model
  so the step-name suffix changes. Renaming the agent or a toolset `id` changes the recorded names
  too. Deploy under a new published version and let in-flight executions drain on the old one.
- **Step results must survive the SDK serializer.** Results are checkpointed through the Lambda
  SDK's serializer. Tool results are encoded by Pydantic first, so structured returns such as
  `ToolReturn` and `BinaryContent` round-trip; a value Pydantic cannot serialize does not.
- **Events cannot leave a running durable execution.** `run_stream` and `iter` do work inside the
  handler and are checkpointed normally, but a durable execution returns a single value when it
  completes, so there is no channel to stream tokens to a caller while it runs. An
  `event_stream_handler` works: model events are handled live inside the model step and each
  agent-level event is checkpointed in its own step.
- **`ctx.enqueue()` is not available inside a durable step**, whether a checkpointed tool or an
  `event_stream_handler` (which runs inside the model step for model events and its own step for
  agent events), because a resumed execution serves the recorded step output and would drop the
  enqueued messages. Enqueue from handler-level code instead.
- **Budgets.** A durable execution allows 3,000 operations and 100 MB of cumulative checkpointed
  state. A turn costs one model step plus one step per tool call, so the operation budget is
  generous, but large tool results consume the state budget: return a reference (an S3 key, say)
  rather than a blob.

## Per-tool configuration

Tool metadata under the `aws_lambda` key configures that tool's step. It accepts the `StepConfig`
fields `retry_strategy`, `step_semantics`, and `serdes`:

```python {test="skip" lint="skip"}
from aws_durable_execution_sdk_python.config import StepSemantics
from pydantic_ai.toolsets import FunctionToolset

toolset = FunctionToolset(id='billing')


@toolset.tool_plain(metadata={'aws_lambda': {'step_semantics': StepSemantics.AT_MOST_ONCE_PER_RETRY}})
def charge_card(amount: int) -> str:
    return f'charged {amount}'
```

`metadata={'aws_lambda': False}` opts a tool out of checkpointing entirely, so it runs inline on
every attempt. Use it for cheap, side-effect-free tools whose result is not worth a checkpoint. MCP
tools cannot opt out, because they perform I/O that must not re-run when the execution resumes.

`AWSLambdaDurability(step_config=...)` sets the base configuration for every step. Per-tool metadata
overrides it key by key, so a tool that sets only `step_semantics` keeps the base `retry_strategy`.

## Composition with other capabilities

`AWSLambdaDurability` orders itself innermost, so any other capability's contribution to a model
request is already applied inside the durable step. Attach it alongside other capabilities as usual.
