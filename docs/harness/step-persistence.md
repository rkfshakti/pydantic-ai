# Step Persistence

`StepPersistence` records what an agent did at each boundary, separate from whether the run can be safely resumed. It is the persistence substrate for orchestrators that delegate to sub-agents -- for example, an AICA orchestrator that spawns a `code_librarian` to investigate one symbol, then continues that delegate's investigation with a follow-up question.

It is not a full graph-state checkpoint. Capability-state restore, workspace snapshots, and graph-node resume are out of scope and tracked separately (see `pydantic-ai-harness` issues #149 and #196).

[Source](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/tree/main/src/pydantic_ai_harness/pydantic_ai_harness/step_persistence/)

> While Pydantic AI Harness is on 0.x releases, the API may change between minor releases; when it does, deprecation warnings and release-note migration guidance tell you (or your agent) exactly how to upgrade. See the [version policy](index.md#version-policy).

## What it gives you

1. **Append-only step events.** Every interesting boundary (run start/end, model request, tool call, failure) appends a `StepEvent`. A run killed mid-tool-call still leaves a usable event trail.
2. **Continuable snapshots.** A `ContinuableSnapshot` is saved at settled node boundaries, and a failing run saves its live at-failure history. Each snapshot carries a `state`: `complete` when every `ToolCallPart` has a matching result, `interrupted` when the capture holds unsettled tool work (e.g. a crash mid-tool-cycle). `latest_snapshot` and `continue_run` return only `complete` snapshots unless the caller passes `include_interrupted=True`. Pass the snapshot's `messages` back to `Agent.run(message_history=...)` to continue or fork.
3. **Tool-effect ledger.** Every tool call's lifecycle (`started`, `completed`, `failed`) is recorded against `(run_id, tool_call_id)`. After a crash, a tool with a `started` record and no terminal update should be treated as `unknown_after_crash`: the side effect may or may not have happened.
4. **Lineage metadata.** `conversation_id` (sequence) and `parent_run_id` (hierarchy) are independent axes. See [Three-level identity](#three-level-identity).

## Quick start

```python
import asyncio

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import StepPersistence
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import InMemoryStepStore

store = InMemoryStepStore()
librarian = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[StepPersistence(store=store, agent_name='code_librarian')],
)


async def main():
    await librarian.run('Find ThinkingPartDelta and confirm the callable allowance')


asyncio.run(main())
```

That is the whole setup. `run_id` is always per-`Agent.run` call, matching pydantic_ai's `RunContext.run_id`. For multi-turn logical grouping use `conversation_id=` -- that is the pydantic_ai-native primitive for it (see [Three-level identity](#three-level-identity)).

`run_id` resolution per call:

- **Explicit `run_id='libr-1'`** becomes the id for this one call. This suits single-shot use cases (a deterministic id for testing, replay, debugging, or a one-off scripted run). Reusing one capability instance with the same explicit `run_id` across multiple `.run()` calls raises `ValueError` in `before_run`. The tool-effect ledger is keyed by `(run_id, tool_call_id)` and providers reuse deterministic tool-call ids, so a silent collision would erase the `unknown_after_crash` signal. Use `conversation_id=` for multi-turn grouping instead.
- **`agent_name` set, `run_id` unset** derives a path-safe base64url encoding of the complete `(agent_name, ctx.run_id)` pair. The encoding is injective within `FileStepStore`'s 200-character limit, so replay addresses the same stored run without collisions between distinct accepted context ids. A longer derived id raises `ValueError` before backend selection, including with the memory, SQLite, and Mongo stores.
- **Neither set** uses `ctx.run_id` unchanged. A missing context run id raises `RuntimeError` because inventing one would disconnect replayed writes.

## Durable execution

`StepPersistence` has the stable capability id `step_persistence`, so it can be attached alongside a Pydantic AI durability capability without passing `id=`. Pass an explicit id only when the same agent has more than one `StepPersistence` instance.

Six store boundaries are durable operations: registration identity, run registration, event append, snapshot save, tool-effect start, and tool-effect completion or failure. Every persisted timestamp is read inside one of those operations, so replay uses the journaled value instead of reading the workflow wall clock again. The journaled registration identity makes a retried registration idempotent while a distinct reuse of the same run id still fails.

Events and snapshots written by the capability carry deterministic per-run idempotency keys. Every built-in store suppresses a key it already applied, while records created directly with `idempotency_key=None` retain append behavior. Snapshot keys use a per-run save sequence together with `step_index` and `state`. Replay produces the same sequence, while distinct snapshots at the same step and state retain their write order and newer history.

The orchestrator pattern -- one logical agent serving many turns -- uses `conversation_id`, not a shared `run_id`:

```python
import asyncio

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import StepPersistence
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import InMemoryStepStore

store = InMemoryStepStore()
orchestrator = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[StepPersistence(store=store, agent_name='orchestrator')],
)


async def main():
    for turn in turns:
        await orchestrator.run(turn, conversation_id='orch-conv')

    # All turns of this orchestrator, chronological:
    records = await store.list_runs(conversation_id='orch-conv')


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Three-level identity

The capability mirrors pydantic_ai's identity stack:

| Concept | Definition | Granularity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `conversation_id` | The dialogue. Resolved by pydantic_ai from the `conversation_id=` argument to `Agent.run`, or the most recent `conversation_id` on `message_history`, or a fresh UUID7. | sequence of runs |
| `run_id` | One `Agent.run` invocation. | one step in the sequence |
| `step_index` | Graph-node count within a run (`ctx.run_step`). | one node within one run |

`StepEvent.conversation_id` and `RunRecord.conversation_id` are populated from `ctx.conversation_id`. So three `.run()` calls sharing one `conversation_id` produce three distinct `run_id`s, all queryable as a group:

```python
import asyncio


async def main():
    runs = await store.list_runs(conversation_id='conv-abc')  # 3 records, chronological


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Continuing a delegate's investigation

pydantic_ai already has `message_history=` for "carry on with this prior context". `StepPersistence` does not introduce a parallel mechanism. It exposes one helper that loads the most recent settled snapshot:

```python
import asyncio

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import StepPersistence
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import InMemoryStepStore, continue_run

store = InMemoryStepStore()
librarian = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[StepPersistence(store=store, agent_name='code_librarian')],
)


async def main():
    # Earlier: tag the first turn with a conversation id so the follow-up can find it.
    await librarian.run(
        'Find ThinkingPartDelta and confirm the callable allowance',
        conversation_id='libr-conv',
    )

    # Later (possibly a different process):
    prior_run = (await store.list_runs(conversation_id='libr-conv'))[-1].run_id
    history = await continue_run(store, run_id=prior_run)
    await librarian.run(
        'Read _apply_provider_details_delta and check the path',
        message_history=history,
        conversation_id='libr-conv',   # keep the conversation grouping
    )


asyncio.run(main())
```

`fork_run(store, run_id=...)` returns the same shape but is intended when the caller wants a branched logical run from that snapshot point (the new run gets a fresh `run_id` and probably a fresh `conversation_id`).

### What "safe to continue from" means

By default `continue_run` returns the messages of the latest `complete` snapshot for that `run_id` -- a point whose tool work was fully settled when captured. Snapshots are written at these boundaries:

- after every `CallToolsNode` whose tool calls all returned -- the pending tool-return request is folded in, so the point is durable the moment the tool completes, before the next model request is even sent,
- at `after_run`, when the run ended past that boundary (a run that reached no boundary at all, or an `Agent.run_stream` whose closing response lands after the last one), and
- when a run *fails*: the live history at failure time is saved, whatever its shape -- a model request that raises after a clean tool cycle produces a `complete` snapshot; a crash mid-tool-cycle produces an `interrupted` one carrying every completed cycle.

An `interrupted` snapshot is sendable on resume -- pydantic-ai (>= 2.10) repairs broken tool-call/result pairing before every model request -- but not necessarily *safe*: a pending tool call may be re-executed (resuming without a new prompt) or closed out with a synthesized `interrupted` return, and neither says whether the original side effect happened. That is the tool-effect ledger's job. So the default read path skips `interrupted` snapshots; pass `include_interrupted=True` to `continue_run` / `fork_run` / `latest_snapshot` after checking `list_unresolved_tool_effects`. If no matching snapshot exists, `continue_run` raises `LookupError`.

## Run lineage: `parent_run_id`

`parent_run_id` is a lineage label, not a functional dependency. It does two things:

- Every `StepEvent` and `RunRecord` carries it, so you can filter and group.
- `store.list_runs(parent_run_id='orch-1')` returns every delegate run pointing at that orchestrator.

It is auto-inferred for in-process delegation: when an orchestrator's tool synchronously calls a delegate's `Agent.run(...)`, the delegate's `StepPersistence` picks up the orchestrator's `run_id` via a `ContextVar` that the orchestrator's `wrap_run` set. No threading required:

```python
import asyncio

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import StepPersistence
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import InMemoryStepStore

store = InMemoryStepStore()
orchestrator = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[StepPersistence(store=store, agent_name='orchestrator')],
)
librarian = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[StepPersistence(store=store, agent_name='code_librarian')],
)


@orchestrator.tool_plain
async def ask_librarian(question: str) -> str:
    result = await librarian.run(question)   # parent_run_id auto-filled
    return result.output


async def main():
    # Tag the orchestrator turn so the lookup below can find its run_id.
    await orchestrator.run(
        'Where is ThinkingPartDelta defined?',
        conversation_id='orch-conv',
    )

    # All librarian runs now point at the orchestrator's run_id:
    orch_run_id = (await store.list_runs(conversation_id='orch-conv'))[-1].run_id
    delegates = await store.list_runs(parent_run_id=orch_run_id)


asyncio.run(main())
```

Set `parent_run_id=` explicitly to override (for example, cross-process delegation where `ContextVar`s do not propagate).

`parent_run_id` is distinct from `conversation_id`. The orchestrator and delegate usually live in different conversations (the orchestrator talks to a user; the delegate talks to itself). But they share a parent-child link.

## Inspecting a run tree

`list_runs` returns matches sorted by `started_at` ascending across all backends -- pick the most recent with `[-1]`.

```python
import asyncio


async def main():
    # Every delegate of one orchestrator run (chronological)
    delegates = await store.list_runs(parent_run_id='orch-3f2a')

    # Every run in one dialogue (multi-turn conversation across many .run() calls)
    turns = await store.list_runs(conversation_id='conv-abc')
    latest_turn = turns[-1]

    # Filters combine (AND):
    focused = await store.list_runs(
        parent_run_id='orch-3f2a',
        conversation_id='libr-conv',
    )

    # Detail per run:
    events = await store.list_events(run_id=delegates[0].run_id)
    snapshot = await store.latest_snapshot(run_id=delegates[0].run_id)
    unresolved = await store.list_unresolved_tool_effects(run_id=delegates[0].run_id)


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Failure recovery

```python
import asyncio


async def main():
    # An earlier delegate run died mid-investigation.
    events = await store.list_events(run_id='libr-3f2a')
    unresolved = await store.list_unresolved_tool_effects(run_id='libr-3f2a')
    for record in unresolved:
        # status == 'started' with no terminal update -- unknown_after_crash.
        print(f'tool {record.tool_name} ({record.tool_call_id}) may or may not have run')
        print(f'  idempotency_key={record.idempotency_key}  '
              f'effect_summary={record.effect_summary}')

    # Decide whether to resume or branch:
    history = await continue_run(store, run_id='libr-3f2a')
    # If the unresolved tools were read-only and safe to redo:
    await librarian.run('continue investigating', message_history=history,
                        conversation_id='libr-conv')
    # If side effects might have happened and the orchestrator wants a fresh attempt:
    history = await fork_run(store, run_id='libr-3f2a')
    # ... pass to a new delegate run with a different agent_name / conversation_id.

    # To resume from the interrupted frontier itself (the crashed cycle included),
    # after checking the unresolved effects above:
    history = await continue_run(store, run_id='libr-3f2a', include_interrupted=True)


asyncio.run(main())
```

Side-effect deduplication is the orchestrator's responsibility. Tools that write external state should annotate their in-flight `ToolEffectRecord` via `annotate_tool_effect`:

```python
from pydantic_ai import RunContext
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import annotate_tool_effect


@orchestrator.tool
async def set_label(ctx: RunContext[Deps], issue: int, label: str) -> str:
    await annotate_tool_effect(
        store,
        ctx,
        idempotency_key=f'issue-{issue}::label::{label}',
        effect_summary=f'set label {label!r} on issue #{issue}',
    )
    await github.set_label(issue, label)   # the actual side effect
    return 'ok'
```

The helper reads the active `run_id` from the `StepPersistence` `ContextVar` and `tool_call_id` / `tool_name` from `ctx`, then merges the metadata into the prior record. It is a no-op when called outside a step-persistence-wrapped tool call. `after_tool_execute` preserves both fields when it writes the terminal `completed` / `failed` entry.

## Compaction receipt handles

`StepPersistence.compaction_transcript_handle()` exposes the current `run_id` to compaction receipts. It is an identifier for this store's persisted run history, not a promise that the pre-compaction transcript remains available: snapshots can already contain compacted history and configured retention can delete older snapshots.

## Backends

- `InMemoryStepStore` -- process-local; great for tests.
- `FileStepStore(directory)` -- directory layout under `<directory>/<run_id>/`:
    - `run.json` -- `RunRecord` (lineage)
    - `events.jsonl` -- append-only `StepEvent`s
    - `tool_effects.jsonl` -- append-only `ToolEffectRecord`s, scoped to this run
    - `snapshot-keys.jsonl` -- replay-suppression keys retained independently of snapshot pruning
    - `snapshots/{seq}.json` -- `ContinuableSnapshot`s, named by a per-run monotonic counter (not `step_index`, which would collide when the same `run_id` is reused across `Agent.run` calls, since `ctx.run_step` resets to 0 each call).
- `SqliteStepStore(database='runs.db')` -- single SQLite file with tables `runs`, `events`, `snapshots`, `snapshot_idempotency_keys`, `tool_effects`, and a sibling `media` table for externalized blobs (see [Persisting media](#persisting-media) below). WAL mode is enabled; `tool_effects` upserts per `(run_id, tool_call_id)` so the latest state wins; snapshots use `AUTOINCREMENT seq` to mirror `FileStepStore._next_snapshot_seq`. Databases created before the snapshot `state` column existed gain it automatically on open (existing rows read as `complete`). Pass `connection=` instead of `database=` to share a `sqlite3.Connection` with the rest of your application; the connection must be opened with `check_same_thread=False` because hook calls are dispatched onto a worker thread.
- `MongoStepStore(client= or db_url=, database=...)` -- MongoDB collections `runs`, `events`, `snapshots`, `snapshot_idempotency_keys`, `tool_effects`, and `counters` (atomic `$inc` allocates the monotonic `seq`). Run registration uses an atomic insert by `runs._id = run_id`; duplicate ids raise `ValueError`. Needs the `mongodb` extra (which installs `pymongo>=4.17.0`); pass a shared `AsyncMongoClient` as `client=`, or a connection string as `db_url=` (the store then owns the client -- call `await store.aclose()` to release it). Individual parts at or above `media_threshold_bytes` externalize by default to a `MongoMediaStore` on the same client. That is a per-value offload, not an aggregate cap: a snapshot of many below-threshold parts can still exceed MongoDB's 16 MiB document limit and fail on insert, so lower the threshold if that is a risk for your workload.

All implement the same async `StepStore` protocol, so capability hooks never block the event loop on the file/sqlite backends (I/O is dispatched via `anyio.to_thread`); the Mongo backend is natively async.

`FileStepStore` validates `run_id` against `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]{1,200}` (and rejects `..`) to prevent path traversal. Callers passing user-controlled IDs should still sanitise first.

### What `MongoStepStore` creates on first write

The store issues `createIndex` on its first write, for ten indexes: `conversation_id` and `parent_run_id` (both sparse) plus `started_at` on `runs`; `(run_id, seq)` and unique keyed `(run_id, idempotency_key)` on `events`; `(run_id, seq)`, unique keyed `(run_id, idempotency_key)`, and `(run_id, state, seq)` on `snapshots`; and a unique `(run_id, tool_call_id)` plus `(run_id, status)` on `tool_effects`. The idempotency indexes include only documents whose key is a string, so `None` retains append behavior. Its default `MongoMediaStore` adds one more, described on the [media page](media.md). Three consequences worth knowing before pointing the store at an existing deployment:

- The connecting user needs the privilege to create indexes. A restricted Atlas role without it fails on the first write, not at construction.
- The unique index build fails if an existing `tool_effects` collection already holds duplicate `(run_id, tool_call_id)` pairs.
- Index builds against already-populated collections cost time and I/O on that first call.

`RunRecord.metadata` and `StepEvent.metadata` are stored as nested documents, so their keys become BSON field names: keys containing `.` or starting with `$` need [MongoDB 5.0 or later](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/dot-dollar-considerations/), and a key containing a NULL byte is rejected by the BSON encoder before it reaches the server. CI exercises both Mongo backends against `mongo:8`.

Install MongoDB support:

```bash
pip/uv-add "pydantic-ai-harness[mongodb]"
```

## Bounding snapshot growth

Each step writes a new full-history snapshot keyed by an incrementing `seq`, and nothing is pruned by default. Within one long `Agent.run` the snapshot count equals the number of settled tool-call steps, so a long single run pays a growing storage cost.

All four stores -- `InMemoryStepStore`, `FileStepStore`, `SqliteStepStore`, and `MongoStepStore` -- accept an opt-in `max_snapshots_per_run: int | None` (default `None`, unbounded -- byte-for-byte the prior behavior). When set to `N >= 1`, each `save_snapshot` prunes the run down to a retain set:

- the newest `N` snapshots by `seq`,
- the newest snapshot overall (serves `latest_snapshot(include_interrupted=True)`),
- the newest `complete` snapshot (serves the default read path).

The last two keep both read modes correct even when the newest `N` snapshots are all `interrupted` and the newest resumable `complete` sits below that window, so the retain set can exceed `N`. `from_spec(..., max_snapshots_per_run=N)` forwards the bound to the store it constructs (`backend='memory'`, `'file'`, or `'sqlite'`; a Mongo store is built directly, not from a spec).

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import FileStepStore

store = FileStepStore('runs', max_snapshots_per_run=8)
```

Pruning a snapshot never deletes its externalized media: blobs are content-addressed and may be shared across snapshots and runs, so orphaned-blob GC is out of scope (see the non-goals below). Age-based (TTL) expiry is out of scope too -- it belongs at whole-run granularity, not per snapshot.

Bounded retention discards older per-step snapshots, including pre-compaction ones. Any downstream that reconstructs history by unioning a run's retained snapshots -- snapshot search or a compaction receipt keyed on `run_id` -- can only see what is retained. With a tight bound (for example `max_snapshots_per_run=1`) the older, pre-compaction states are gone, so treat the bound as a hard limit on how far back such recovery can reach. Leave the bound at `None`, or set it high enough to cover the history you need to recover, when historical reconstruction matters.

## Persisting media

`BinaryContent` payloads (images, audio, documents, video) inlined as base64 inside a snapshot would balloon every file or row containing the message; a large text part (e.g. a big tool-return string) does the same and can push a `MongoStepStore` snapshot past MongoDB's 16 MiB document cap ([#440](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/issues/440)). The file, sqlite, and mongo backends externalize any `BinaryContent.data`, and any part whose string `content` is at or above **64 KiB**, through a configured `MediaStore`, leaving a URI reference in the snapshot. The same `media_threshold_bytes` governs binary and text alike; there is no separate text knob. Round-trip is transparent: `latest_snapshot(...).messages[*]` returns the original `BinaryContent` bytes and text.

Text externalization is not Mongo-only and has no opt-out short of `media_store=None`: the walker is shared, so an existing `FileStepStore` or `SqliteStepStore` deployment starts writing blobs for large text parts as well as binary ones from this release on. Snapshots written before it still restore -- the reader recognises the older binary marker shape. This compatibility is upgrade-only: a release that predates text externalization treats every marker as binary, so it cannot validate a snapshot containing an externalized text marker. Keep a current reader for persisted snapshots that contain those markers.

Reserved-key escaping is a second marker-format generation with the same rule for these stores: a payload using the marker format's namespaced keys is moved into a versioned reserved mapping (the `__harness_external_escaped_keys__` stash, stamped with the format version under `__harness_external_marker_format__`), and the current reader moves those values back to their own keys. Compatibility the other way is upgrade-only. A reader that predates the escaping format re-inlines the externalized field correctly, but it leaves both reserved keys sitting in the restored payload rather than removing them. A marker carrying both, stamped with a version this reader does not know, is rejected rather than restored with the reserved values stripped: `restore_media` raises `ValueError`, and `latest_snapshot` surfaces it to the caller for the file, sqlite, and mongo stores. `list_snapshots` is different: each store treats the failed snapshot as unparsable, skips it, and logs the error, so an unknown version shows up as a missing snapshot rather than an exception. That rejection is the version gate and is intended, but store users have to anticipate it. Keep a current reader for persisted snapshots that contain escaped markers.

| StepStore           | Default `media_store`                  | Where blobs live                      |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `InMemoryStepStore` | not applicable                         | bytes stay in the in-memory snapshot  |
| `FileStepStore`     | `DiskMediaStore(<root>/media/)`        | `<root>/media/<sha256>.bin`           |
| `SqliteStepStore`   | `SqliteMediaStore(database=<same db>)` | sibling `media` table in the same DB  |
| `MongoStepStore`    | `MongoMediaStore(client=<same client>)` | sibling `media` + `media_chunks` collections |

Override the destination by passing your own `MediaStore`:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.media import S3MediaStore
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import FileStepStore

store = FileStepStore(
    'runs',
    media_store=S3MediaStore(
        bucket='my-bucket',
        endpoint='https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com',
        region='auto',
        access_key_id=...,
        secret_access_key=...,
    ),
    media_threshold_bytes=64 * 1024,  # raise or lower if you want
)
```

Opt out entirely (keep bytes inline in the snapshot JSON/row):

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import FileStepStore, SqliteStepStore

FileStepStore('runs', media_store=None)
SqliteStepStore(database='runs.db', media_store=None)
```

URIs are `media+sha256://<hex>`, content-addressed. The same blob written through any `MediaStore` resolves the same way, so dedup is automatic and moving the underlying storage is a one-line swap. The shipped implementations are:

- `DiskMediaStore(directory)` -- one file per blob at `<directory>/<sha256>.bin`.
- `SqliteMediaStore(database=...)` or `SqliteMediaStore(connection=...)` -- one row per blob (`INSERT OR IGNORE` for content-addressed dedup).
- `S3MediaStore(bucket=, endpoint=, region=, access_key_id=, secret_access_key=)` -- path-style URLs plus handrolled SigV4. Compatible with AWS S3, Cloudflare R2 (`region='auto'`), MinIO, and other S3-compatible providers. PUT/GET/HEAD only -- no multipart, lifecycle, or listing in v1.
- `MongoMediaStore(client= or db_url=, database=...)` -- MongoDB, needs the `mongodb` extra. Each blob is sha256-addressed chunks across a `media` manifest document and a sibling `media_chunks` collection (manual chunking rather than GridFS, so dedup is preserved -- see the [media page](media.md)), so a blob larger than one BSON document still stores and reads back. Chunking bounds the document, not memory: there is no streaming API, so each blob is held whole in process memory on both `put` and `get`. The manifest holds `MediaContext.metadata` inline and is not chunked, so keep per-blob metadata small. `collection=` renames both collections and `chunk_size_bytes=` (default 8 MiB) sets the split size.

### Exposing externalized bytes as URLs

Each store accepts a `public_url=` callable that turns the canonical `media+sha256://<hex>` URI into a URL the model can fetch directly. The forthcoming `MediaExternalizer` capability will use this to swap `BinaryContent` parts for `ImageUrl` / `AudioUrl` / other URL parts before the model sees the message, letting providers fetch big media over the wire without re-encoding bytes into the request body.

Static base URL (public R2 bucket, CDN):

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.media import S3MediaStore, make_static_public_url

store = S3MediaStore(
    bucket='my-bucket',
    endpoint='https://<acc>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com',
    region='auto',
    access_key_id=..., secret_access_key=...,
    key_prefix='media/',
    public_url=make_static_public_url('https://pub-abc.r2.dev', key_prefix='media/'),
)
```

Presigned or rotating-signature URL -- pass any async callable that takes `(uri, MediaContext)`:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.media import MediaContext, S3MediaStore

### `MediaContext`, an extensible per-operation bag

Every `MediaStore` method (`put`, `get`, `exists`, `public_url`, `get_metadata`) and both user-supplied callables (`PublicUrlResolver`, `KeyStrategy`) accept a `MediaContext`:

```python
from collections.abc import Mapping
from dataclasses import dataclass, field


@dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True)
class MediaContext:
    media_type: str | None = None                    # e.g. 'image/png'
    filename: str | None = None                      # original filename, when known
    metadata: Mapping[str, str] = field(default_factory=dict)  # user-supplied tags
```

All fields default; new fields are added non-breakingly as use cases emerge. Pass what you have, ignore the rest.

**Persistence by store.** `get_metadata(uri)` round-trips the user-supplied `metadata` mapping on all four stores. `media_type` is also persisted but is not part of what `get_metadata` returns (it is stored for the byte payload itself, for example as the `Content-Type`).

- `SqliteMediaStore` writes `metadata` to a JSON column and `media_type` to a dedicated column.
- `S3MediaStore` sends `metadata` as signed `x-amz-meta-*` headers (ASCII alphanumeric plus dash key names) and `media_type` as `Content-Type`; `get_metadata` reads the `x-amz-meta-*` values back from the HEAD response.
- `DiskMediaStore` writes a sidecar JSON file (`<resolved>.meta.json`) alongside each blob, atomic via tmp plus rename. Sidecars are absent only when the put carried no metadata.
- `MongoMediaStore` writes `metadata` as a JSON string and `media_type` as a dedicated field on the blob's manifest document (the `media` collection by default); `get_metadata` decodes the JSON string back. Because the mapping is one JSON string rather than nested fields, metadata keys are not subject to BSON field-name rules here.

### `key_strategy`: controlling the backend storage path

Default is `<sha256>.bin`. `DiskMediaStore` and `S3MediaStore` accept overrides to fit existing layouts; `SqliteMediaStore` and `MongoMediaStore` do not (the digest is their primary key, so a user-chosen key would either break dedup or be a no-op -- use `table=` / `collection=` to move the rows or documents):

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.media import DiskMediaStore, MediaContext


def by_media_type(uri: str, ctx: MediaContext) -> str:
    digest = uri.removeprefix('media+sha256://')
    ext = {'image/png': '.png', 'image/jpeg': '.jpg'}.get(ctx.media_type or '', '.bin')
    return f'images/{digest}{ext}'


store = DiskMediaStore('runs', key_strategy=by_media_type)
```

**Caveat**: if your strategy depends on `context.media_type` (for example, to pick an extension), `get(uri)` and `exists(uri)` will not find the blob unless the same context is supplied at read time. For pure path-organisation strategies (no context dependency) the constraint does not apply.

`DiskMediaStore` rejects strategies that produce absolute paths or paths containing `..` segments, to prevent escaping the store directory.

Separately, all four stores accept a `public_url=` resolver, useful when a CDN, local HTTP server, or signed-URL service fronts the bytes. Without it `public_url(...)` returns `None` (the model never sees a URL unless a resolver is configured and it returns a string).

pydantic_ai providers transparently download bytes from a URL when the target model does not natively accept that URL type, so emitting a URL is always safe: you only ever lose wire savings, never correctness.

!!! note "The future `MediaExternalizer` capability"
    When it lands, the composition will be `Agent(capabilities=[MediaExternalizer(store), StepPersistence(...)])` and `StepPersistence` will see already-URL-ified messages, so the externalize walk becomes a no-op. The existing API does not change.

### Persisting to unsupported backends

DynamoDB, Postgres, Redis, GCS, and other backends are out of scope for this release. Write your own `StepStore` (about ten methods on a Protocol) or your own `MediaStore` (five methods: `put`, `get`, `exists`, `public_url`, `get_metadata`) and pass it via `store=` / `media_store=`. Please open an issue if you ship one -- we want to feed the eventual shared adapter layer with N >= 3 real implementations before abstracting.

## Conversation heads and background names

`pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence.conversations` provides
`SqliteConversationStore`, `ConversationSummary`, and `SavedConversation` for
multi-turn applications. A conversation head is separate from per-run checkpoints:
it includes accepted prompts and between-run edits such as compaction. Do not
reconstruct it by concatenating overlapping run snapshots.

`save(summary=..., messages=...)` compares the supplied content revision and
returns the committed summary. A stale writer or a deleted session raises
`ConversationConflict`. `get(conversation_id=...)` restores messages through the
same media format used by step snapshots. `listing(query=..., limit=..., offset=...)`
returns summaries without loading messages; search matches saved user/assistant
text and metadata using Unicode case folding, including text entries within
multimodal prompts. Search does not include tool output, reasoning, or discarded
pre-compaction history. Unknown metadata schema versions are rejected.

Metadata naming uses a separate version. `name(source=..., title=..., ...)` cannot
overwrite a newer content revision, newer name, or a manual title. Naming does not
change the activity timestamp. `delete(source=...)` removes the conversation and
associated run records from the same SQLite database atomically, retaining shared
media. It is not secure erasure. A local live PID marks an unfinished conversation
as busy; this is not a distributed lease and the database must not be shared
between hosts. PID reuse is conservatively treated as busy.

The database is created owner-only where supported. Contents are not encrypted.
There is no automatic conversation TTL or media garbage collection.

`pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence.naming` provides a tool-free naming agent
and `SessionNamer`, a worker owned by the application's task group. `submit(id)`
coalesces jobs in a queue bounded to ten sessions. `run()` processes one job at a
time until its owner cancels it. `backfill(entries)` considers up to ten newest
entries. Naming failures are logged at debug level and leave existing metadata
usable; cancellation propagates. Applications must join the worker before closing
its model clients or storage dependencies.

Names consist of a short title, subtitle, and up to four tags. The model receives
the prior title/detail plus a bounded 2,400-character current conversation tail.
This is deliberately not a message-index cursor: compaction and recovery can
replace the list. Generated names become eligible again after 16 content
revisions. Manual names are not changed. Naming requests have a 60-second worker
timeout and the provided `generate_name` helper allows at most two model requests
and 250 output tokens. The helper's agent is named `session_namer`, has no tools,
and does not inherit the foreground agent's capabilities.

Core's agent spans attribute auxiliary model calls to `session_namer`; no second
span hierarchy is emitted. Successful naming response token counts are stored
separately from foreground history, including results rejected as stale while the
session still exists. Failed or timed-out requests may incur provider usage not
available to the application. Monetary pricing of auxiliary calls is not included
in retained-history cost. Applications choose the naming model and disclose the
additional provider requests to their users.

## Earlier checkpoints and notifications

Set `capture_frontier=True` to save accepted request histories before model
requests and the model response frontier before tool execution. The default is
`False` to preserve existing checkpoint frequency. CLAI enables it. A first model
request failure can then retain its prompt, and a process killed mid-tool-cycle
can retain the proposed calls and arguments even before a cycle settles.

`inspect_recovery(store=..., run_id=...)` in
`pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence.recovery` returns the newest and settled
snapshots, unresolved effects, and names of recorded completed/failed tools.
It does not infer that an effect is safe to replay.

These are still message checkpoints, not graph-state checkpoints. Snapshots at
unsettled frontiers are `interrupted` and remain off the default read path.
`after_run` compares final content, not only message count, to catch same-length
or shortened history rewrites. Put the recorder before capabilities whose
`after_run` transforms history: core runs after-hooks in reverse order. Snapshot
message values are copied before storage so later mutations cannot alter a saved
in-memory checkpoint through shared references.

`SnapshotSaved` is a typed capability event emitted after a checkpoint write
completes. It carries `persistence_run_id`, `conversation_id`, `step_index`, and
`state`. Subscribe using core's `hooks.on.event(SnapshotSaved)` or CLAI's
`host.on(SnapshotSaved)`. Store writes are the source of truth; notifications may
repeat during durable replay and observer failures cannot undo committed writes.

### Core boundary for stronger interrupted-step recovery

Automatic execution recovery is not implemented. Two core contracts should be
addressed before promising it:

1. `on_run_error` should expose authoritative post-cleanup history. Today Harness
   stashes a live list reference from node/request hooks because the outer error
   context can reference the start-of-run list. That depends on core continuing
   to mutate the working history in place. Core's cancellation result APIs are
   useful to callers, but do not establish the same contract for every error hook.
2. An awaited checkpoint boundary should expose normalized results as individual
   tools settle, including accompanying user content, retries, and parallel
   siblings. `after_tool_execute` sees raw results before all normalization;
   `after_node_run` sees a settled batch. `FunctionToolResultEvent` exposes a
   normalized result, but observing a stream is not an atomic commit of that
   result with the tool-effect ledger and the execution frontier.

A hard kill during a parallel batch can therefore leave a completed effect with
no persisted result. A `started` effect is unknown after a crash, and even a
`failed` tool may have made partial external changes. Returning to an older
`complete` checkpoint does not undo those changes. Tools with external effects
need their own idempotency/reconciliation strategy. No Harness event can make an
external side effect atomic with a local SQLite write.

Tests cover a real subprocess kill, early-request failure, final-history rewrite,
revision conflicts, and bounded/cancelled naming. The kill test confirms that
frontier capture survives without error hooks; it is not an exactly-once execution
guarantee.

## What this capability does not do

- It does not restore capability per-run state, graph-node state, retry counters, or in-flight streaming responses.
- It does not deduplicate replayed side effects automatically. Tools that write artifacts, labels, PRs, or external state should call `annotate_tool_effect(store, ctx, ...)` (see [Failure recovery](#failure-recovery)) so the orchestrator can decide whether replay is safe.
- It does not prune events, and by default does not prune snapshots. Retention is the caller's responsibility; snapshot growth can be bounded opt-in with `max_snapshots_per_run` (see [Bounding snapshot growth](#bounding-snapshot-growth)).
- It does not garbage-collect externalized media. Pruning a snapshot leaves its content-addressed blobs in place, since they may be shared across snapshots and runs.
- It does not emit OpenTelemetry spans. pydantic_ai's `Instrumentation` capability already spans `agent run` / `chat` / `running tool` and populates `gen_ai.agent.name`, `gen_ai.agent.call.id`, `gen_ai.conversation.id` via baggage. A future change may add step-persistence attributes to the active span; that is tracked as a follow-up issue.
