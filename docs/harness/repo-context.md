# Repo Context

`RepoContext` discovers and loads a repo's accumulated coding-assistant context engineering (CE): the instruction files (`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`) scattered across the tree and the assets under `.claude`/`.agents`/`.codex`/`.grok` (skills, sub-agents, hooks).

## The problem

A repo accumulates CE for whatever coding assistant worked in it: instruction files (`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`) scattered across the tree, and assets under `.claude`/`.agents`/`.codex`/`.grok` (skills, sub-agents, hooks). An agent that loads only the top-level instruction file misses the ancestor context and has no idea the rest of the setup exists, so it can neither honor it nor translate it.

## The solution

`RepoContext` bundles three strategies, each independently toggleable. Construct it with `RepoContext(...)` in an `Agent`'s `capabilities`, with a workspace attached to the run:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import LocalWorkspace
from pydantic_ai_harness import RepoContext

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-opus-5-5',
    capabilities=[LocalWorkspace('.'), RepoContext(home_dir=Path.home())],
)

result = agent.run_sync('Summarize the coding-assistant setup in this repo.')
print(result.output)
```

`RepoContext` reads from the run's [workspace](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/core-concepts/workspace/), starting at its working directory. To point it at a subdirectory, set it on the workspace: `LocalWorkspace('./repo')`. `home_dir` and `asset_roots` are paths in the workspace: relative ones resolve from the working directory, and `~` is not expanded. A run without a workspace fails at its start.

### 1. Walk-up instruction autoload (on by default)

Loads `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` from the working directory and every ancestor up to `home_dir` (inclusive). Precedence is ancestor-first, workspace-last: broadest context first, most specific last. Files are deduped by visited path and by content hash, so a symlinked `AGENTS.md -> CLAUDE.md` or two ancestors sharing identical content load once. Symlinks to instruction files outside the directory being scanned are skipped, including shared dotfiles in another directory.

When `home_dir` is `None` (the default), only the working directory is scanned -- no walk-up. Pass the workspace home path explicitly to walk up to it. For a remote sandbox, use its home (for example `home_dir='/home/user'` on E2B), not the agent host's `Path.home()`.

### 2. Asset inventory (on by default)

Exposes one tool, `inventory_agent_context()`, that reports where the repo's CE assets live -- the `.claude`/`.agents`/`.codex`/`.grok` roots and, within each, the `skills/` (`SKILL.md`), `agents/` (`.md`), and `settings.json` (hooks) it contains. It returns a structured `AgentContextInventory`; it locates assets and does not parse them, leaving translation to the orchestrator.

Rename the tool with `inventory_tool_name`, or scope which roots it scans with `asset_roots`.
Skill discovery goes at most eight directories deep.

### 3. Nested-on-traversal (off by default)

When the model lists or reads a directory, surface that directory's
`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`. This strategy subscribes to `FileReadEvent` and
`DirectoryListedEvent`, so it receives normalized, containment-checked paths
instead of inspecting raw tool arguments. It remains opt-in:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import LocalWorkspace
from pydantic_ai_harness import FileSystem, RepoContext

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-opus-5-5',
    capabilities=[
        LocalWorkspace('.'),
        FileSystem(),
        RepoContext(
            nested_traversal=True,
            nested_inject='pointer',  # or 'contents'
        ),
    ],
)
result = agent.run_sync('List the source directory.')
```

`nested_inject='pointer'` (default) enqueues a one-line note pointing at the
file; `'contents'` enqueues the file body. The note reaches message history
before the next model request. Each directory is surfaced at most once per run.

`FileSystem` emits these events directly. Hosts with other file tools can emit
the same types by importing `FileReadEvent` and `DirectoryListedEvent` from
`pydantic_ai_harness.filesystem`; set `root_dir` to the directory the event's
`path` is relative to.

The traversed location is `root_dir / path`, so a `FileSystem` rooted at a
subdirectory of the working directory still surfaces the right directory. A
traversal that resolves outside the working directory is ignored: it is not nested in
the workspace, so there is no nested context to surface.

`traversal_tool_names` and `traversal_path_arg` are deprecated. Setting either
to a non-default value emits `HarnessDeprecationWarning` and keeps the old
tool-name and argument sniffing path active for hosts that do not emit events.
With the defaults, sniffing is disabled, so a `FileSystem` event cannot deliver
the same note twice.

## Cache cost

Injecting file contents into the system prompt costs prompt-cache stability: a changed prefix re-bills the whole cached region. `RepoContext` keeps the two cache-relevant paths separate:

- Strategy 1 reads its files once at run start and injects them as static system instructions, so the cached prefix stays byte-identical across turns.
- Strategy 3 is volatile (it depends on which directory was just touched), so its note is enqueued in the message tail, never in the system prompt, and cannot invalidate the cached prefix.

## Configuration

```python {test="skip"}
RepoContext(
    home_dir=None,                  # str | Path | None -- shallowest workspace dir to stop walk-up at, inclusive
    filenames=('CLAUDE.md', 'AGENTS.md'),
    autoload_instructions=True,     # Strategy 1
    expose_inventory_tool=True,     # Strategy 2
    inventory_tool_name='inventory_agent_context',
    nested_traversal=False,         # Strategy 3
    nested_inject='pointer',        # 'pointer' | 'contents'
    traversal_tool_names=frozenset({'list_directory', 'read_file'}),  # deprecated fallback
    traversal_path_arg='path',                                       # deprecated fallback
    asset_roots=('.claude', '.agents', '.codex', '.grok'),
)
```

`workspace_dir=` is deprecated and ignored: the working directory comes from the workspace.

## Scope

`RepoContext` locates and loads CE; it does not parse skill/sub-agent frontmatter or hook bodies, and it does not rewrite or translate assets. Strategy 1 reads its files once per run, so mid-run edits to those files are not reloaded.
