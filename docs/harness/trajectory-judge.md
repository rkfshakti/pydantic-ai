# Trajectory Judge

Watch a live agent run with a second model, and steer it back on course mid-run.

[Source](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/tree/main/src/pydantic_ai_harness/pydantic_ai_harness/trajectory_judge/)

> While Pydantic AI Harness is on 0.x releases, the API may change between minor releases; when it does, deprecation warnings and release-note migration guidance tell you (or your agent) exactly how to upgrade. See the [version policy](index.md#version-policy).

## The problem

Long-horizon runs drift. Instructions fade, unsupported claims compound, and the agent wanders away from the goal. [Guardrails](guardrails.md) catch policy violations at fixed boundaries, and evals score the run after it ends, when recovery costs a whole re-run. Neither watches the trajectory *as it unfolds* and intervenes while a correction is still cheap.

## The solution

`TrajectoryJudge` reviews the run's recent trajectory with a second model on a cadence: every `every` model requests, the most recent `window` tokens of the conversation (user messages, assistant messages, tool calls, and tool results, rendered as a transcript) go to the judge model for evaluation. The evaluation runs concurrently with the agent, so the run is never blocked waiting on a judge.

The judge delivers exactly one verdict per evaluation, as its output type:

- `AllGood` -- the run is on track; nothing happens.
- `Steer(message=...)` -- the run needs correction; the message is enqueued into the running conversation (`RunContext.enqueue`, `'asap'` priority) and delivered on the next model request, attributed to the judge: `Steering from trajectory judge 'hallucination-check': ...`.

Steering is the judge's *output*, not a tool it calls: the judge knows it gets one final verdict per evaluation, rather than being tempted to steer repeatedly mid-thought.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import TrajectoryJudge

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-5',
    capabilities=[
        TrajectoryJudge(
            model='anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5',
            instructions='Flag claims that lack evidence from files the agent actually read.',
            every=20,
        )
    ],
)

result = agent.run_sync('Fix the flaky checkout test and add a regression test.')
print(result.output)
```

## Cadence and window

- `every` counts model requests within the run; the judge evaluates on each multiple.
- `window` bounds what each evaluation sees: the transcript is clamped to its most recent `window` tokens (estimated at ~4 characters per token), so per-evaluation cost stays bounded no matter how long the run gets.
- At most one evaluation per judge is in flight at a time. A cadence tick that finds the previous evaluation still running is skipped, so a slow judge falls behind rather than piling up concurrent calls.
- An evaluation still in flight when the run ends is cancelled: its steering would have nowhere to go.

## Several judges

Each judge is its own capability instance; add one per concern. They schedule and evaluate independently, and each steering message carries its own attribution (`name`, the judge agent's `name`, or `'trajectory-judge'`).

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import TrajectoryJudge

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-5',
    capabilities=[
        TrajectoryJudge(
            model='anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5',
            name='hallucination-check',
            instructions='Flag claims that lack evidence from files the agent actually read.',
            every=20,
        ),
        TrajectoryJudge(
            model='google:gemini-3.7-flash',
            name='scope-creep',
            instructions='Flag work that was not asked for in the original request.',
            every=10,
        ),
    ],
)
```

## Advanced: bring your own judge agent

For anything beyond a model and a review focus (model settings, toolsets, fallback models, custom instructions), pass a full `Agent` instead of piling knobs onto the capability. Every evaluation runs it with `output_type=[AllGood, Steer]`, so the verdict contract is enforced at the run boundary whatever output type the agent was configured with, and an existing agent can be reused as-is only when it is dependency-free; judge dependencies are not passed to evaluations. The one constraint: the judge agent must not have output validators, which are incompatible with a per-run `output_type`.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import TrajectoryJudge
from pydantic_ai_harness.trajectory_judge import AllGood, Steer

judge = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.6-luna',
    name='security-risk',
    instructions=(
        'You review an AI agent trajectory for security risks: exposed secrets, unsafe '
        'file access, and unexpected egress. Return all-good, or steer with a specific warning.'
    ),
    output_type=[AllGood, Steer],
)

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-5',
    capabilities=[TrajectoryJudge(agent=judge, every=10)],
)
```

`agent` is mutually exclusive with `model`/`instructions`: the passed agent owns its own instructions.

## Cost and failure semantics

- The judge's model usage is threaded onto the run's `usage` and respects the run's `usage_limits`: each launch claims one request on the shared usage before the evaluation starts, so the parent's next request and concurrent judges account for in-flight evaluations and the shared request limit cannot be exceeded. A launch the request budget cannot fit skips the tick, like one that finds an evaluation still in flight. The judge run is filed under the judged run's `conversation_id`.
- An evaluation failure is raised on the run at the next cadence tick or at run end; judge failures are never silently dropped. If you need a judge to degrade instead, give it a fallback model through `agent` (for example a `FallbackModel`): resilience policy belongs to the judge agent, not to fields on the capability.
- A judged run inside a [durable execution](../durable_execution/overview.md) workflow or flow (Temporal, DBOS, Prefect) is rejected with `UserError` before the first model request: the evaluation is launched from a capability hook in orchestration context, so its model calls would not be checkpointed and could repeat on replay. A durable-capable agent run outside its workflow or flow is unaffected. Run judged work outside durable execution.

## Observability

`on_verdict` is called with each verdict after it is processed (after any steering has been enqueued):

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness import TrajectoryJudge

TrajectoryJudge(
    model='anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5',
    every=20,
    on_verdict=lambda verdict: print(f'judge verdict: {verdict}'),
)
```

## Composition

- [System Reminders](system-reminders.md) is the rule-based sibling: cadence or condition-triggered reminders with no extra model call. Reach for it first; a trajectory judge earns its cost when the condition requires actually understanding the trajectory.
- [Guardrails](guardrails.md) remain the enforcement boundary for inputs, tool calls, and outputs. A judge observes and steers; it does not block or rewrite anything.

## Not spec-serializable

`TrajectoryJudge.get_serialization_name()` returns `None`: the capability may hold a live `Agent` instance and a callback, which cannot be serialized to an [agent spec](../agent-spec.md).

## Further reading

- [Pydantic AI capabilities](../capabilities/overview.md)
- [Hooks](../hooks.md) -- `after_model_request` drives the cadence; `wrap_run` settles the judge at run end
- [System Reminders](system-reminders.md) -- rule-based mid-run steering without a second model
