# LocalStack

`LocalStack` gives an agent access to an emulated AWS environment, so it can
provision and exercise AWS services without touching a real account. It wires
the AWS CLI to a running [LocalStack](https://www.localstack.cloud/) instance --
injecting the endpoint, region, and credentials -- and can optionally start and
stop the LocalStack Docker container for each run.

> While Pydantic AI Harness is on 0.x releases, the API may change between minor releases; when it does, deprecation warnings and release-note migration guidance tell you (or your agent) exactly how to upgrade. See the [version policy](index.md#version-policy).

## The problem

Agents that build or test cloud infrastructure need somewhere to create buckets,
tables, queues, and functions. Pointing them at real AWS is slow, costs money,
risks leaking credentials, and is hard to reset between runs. LocalStack
emulates the AWS APIs locally, but wiring an agent to it means repeating the same
boilerplate: injecting the endpoint URL, supplying dummy credentials, shelling
out to the AWS CLI, and checking which services are up.

## Usage

`LocalStack` exposes AWS tooling wired to a running LocalStack instance. The
agent issues plain AWS CLI commands; the capability injects the endpoint, region,
and credentials, and adds a health check for the emulated services.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import LocalStack

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
    capabilities=[LocalStack()],
)

result = agent.run_sync('Create an S3 bucket called reports and list all buckets.')
print(result.output)
```

By default the agent connects to a LocalStack instance you started separately --
for example with the
[`localstack` CLI](https://docs.localstack.cloud/aws/tooling/localstack-cli/)
(`localstack start`). The defaults match LocalStack's conventions: the edge
endpoint `http://localhost.localstack.cloud:4566` (which resolves to
`127.0.0.1`) and `test` / `test` credentials. Set `manage_container=True` to have
the capability start and stop a fresh Docker container per run.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `aws_cli` | Run an AWS CLI command against LocalStack. Pass the command **without** the leading `aws` and **without** `--endpoint-url` -- both are injected. Returns labelled stdout/stderr plus an exit code on failure. |
| `localstack_health` | Query LocalStack's health endpoint and return the JSON of which services (s3, dynamodb, sqs, etc.) are available. |

Commands run as an argument vector (no shell), so shell operators and
redirection in the command string have no effect. Output is labelled with
`[stdout]` / `[stderr]` markers and an `[exit code: N]` line on non-zero exit.
When it exceeds `max_output_chars` the **tail** is kept (the head is dropped),
so errors survive truncation.

The AWS CLI can read from and write to local files through arguments such as
`--body`, `file://`, `fileb://`, and `s3 cp`. Treat this capability as both
AWS-emulator access and AWS CLI access to the process's filesystem.

## Service controls

| Field | Effect |
|---|---|
| `allowed_services` | If non-empty, only these AWS services may be used (allowlist), e.g. `['s3', 'dynamodb']`. |
| `denied_services` | These AWS services are always rejected (denylist). |

`allowed_services` and `denied_services` are mutually exclusive -- set one, not
both. The service is the first non-flag token of the command (`s3` in `s3 ls`).

!!! warning "Best-effort, not a security boundary"
    These checks gate which commands the agent issues, not what it can reach.
    For hard guarantees, configure LocalStack itself with the narrowest service
    and IAM behavior the run needs, and run the agent under OS-level isolation.

## Managing the container

Set `manage_container=True` and the capability starts a LocalStack Docker
container for each run and stops it when the run ends, so the agent always gets a
fresh, isolated environment. Docker must be installed and running.

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness import LocalStack

LocalStack(
    manage_container=True,
    image='localstack/localstack',
    container_env={'DEBUG': '1', 'PERSISTENCE': '1'},
    startup_timeout=120.0,
)
```

The container's edge port (`4566`) is published on the host port from
`endpoint_url`, and the capability waits for the health endpoint before the run
starts, then stops the container when it ends (even if the run raises). Each run
gets its own container, so concurrent runs of one agent need distinct host ports
or an externally managed instance (`manage_container=False`).

Since LocalStack 2026.03.0 the default `localstack/localstack` image is a single
image that requires an auth token to start (a free Hobby/OSS token covers
community usage). When `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN` is set in the current process it
is forwarded to the container automatically; a legacy `LOCALSTACK_API_KEY` value
is forwarded when no auth token is set. Auth values are forwarded through the
Docker CLI environment rather than embedded in the `docker run` arguments. The
default `localstack/localstack` image requires a token to start, so a managed run
needs one configured. To run tokenless, set `image` to a tag from before the
account requirement, such as a `localstack/localstack:4.x` release.

Docker-backed services such as Lambda need the Docker socket mounted, and some
services expose ports outside the gateway (LocalStack reserves `4510-4559`).
Enable those explicitly when a service you test requires them:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness import LocalStack

LocalStack(manage_container=True, service_port_range='4510-4559', mount_docker_socket=True)
```

Mounting the Docker socket gives the container host-level Docker control. Keep
`mount_docker_socket=False` unless the emulated service requires it and the run
environment is already trusted.

The same lifecycle is available standalone as an async context manager:

```python
import asyncio

from pydantic_ai_harness.localstack import LocalStackContainer


async def main() -> None:
    async with LocalStackContainer(environment={'DEBUG': '1'}) as localstack:
        ...  # talk to localstack.endpoint_url


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Configuration

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness import LocalStack

LocalStack(
    endpoint_url='http://localhost.localstack.cloud:4566',  # edge endpoint (host port reused when managed)
    region='us-east-1',                    # region for the CLI and environment
    access_key_id='test',                  # LocalStack accepts any value
    secret_access_key='test',              # LocalStack accepts any value
    allowed_services=[],                   # allowlist (mutually exclusive with denied)
    denied_services=[],                    # denylist
    default_timeout=60.0,                  # seconds, per command and health check
    max_output_chars=50_000,               # output cap returned to the model
    aws_cli_path='aws',                    # CLI executable (e.g. 'aws' or 'awslocal')
    manage_container=False,                # start/stop a Docker container per run
    image='localstack/localstack',         # image used when managing the container
    host_address='127.0.0.1',              # host address for Docker port publishing
    service_port_range=None,               # e.g. '4510-4559' for non-gateway service ports
    mount_docker_socket=False,             # required by Docker-backed services such as Lambda
    container_name=None,                   # optional name for the managed container
    container_env={},                      # env vars for the managed container
    docker_path='docker',                  # Docker executable
    startup_timeout=120.0,                 # seconds to wait for the container to be ready
    include_instructions=True,             # add usage instructions to the prompt
)
```

The AWS CLI must be installed and on `PATH` (or point `aws_cli_path` at it). If
the binary is missing, `aws_cli` returns a clear error instead of aborting the
run. Set `include_instructions=False` to omit the capability's prompt text when
you supply your own.

## Agent spec (YAML/JSON)

`LocalStack` works with Pydantic AI's
[agent spec](../agent-spec.md):

```yaml
# agent.yaml
model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6
capabilities:
  - LocalStack:
      endpoint_url: http://localhost.localstack.cloud:4566
      allowed_services: ['s3', 'dynamodb', 'sqs']
```

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import LocalStack

agent = Agent.from_file('agent.yaml', custom_capability_types=[LocalStack])
```

Pass `custom_capability_types` so the spec loader knows how to instantiate
`LocalStack`.
