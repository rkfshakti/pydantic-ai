# Ask User

Let the model ask the user multiple-choice questions mid-run and wait for the answers.

[Source](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/tree/main/src/pydantic_ai_harness/pydantic_ai_harness/ask_user/)

> While Pydantic AI Harness is on 0.x releases, the API may change between minor releases; when it does, deprecation warnings and release-note migration guidance tell you (or your agent) exactly how to upgrade. See the [version policy](index.md#version-policy).

## The problem

An agent given an ambiguous task either guesses or buries a question in its output and stops.
Guessing wastes a run; a question in prose is only found by a person reading the whole answer.
The model needs a way to ask a small, structured question and get the answer back as data.

## The solution

`AskUser` exposes one tool, `ask_user_question`. The model passes one to ten questions, each
with a short `header`, the question text, two to six options (a `label` and an optional
`description`), and `multi_select` when several answers are allowed. The capability validates
the call, hands it to your `answerer`, and returns the picked labels keyed by header. If the
user declines, the model is told so and the run continues.

The capability owns the schema and validation. It never prints, reads stdin, or imports a
terminal library: the `answerer` is whatever puts the questions in front of a person, and you
supply it. There is no default, because a capability that reads stdin is unusable from a server.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import AskUser
from pydantic_ai_harness.ask_user import AskUserAnswer, AskUserRequest, AskUserResponse


async def pick_first(request: AskUserRequest) -> AskUserResponse:
    answers = [AskUserAnswer(header=q.header, selected=(q.options[0].label,)) for q in request.questions]
    return AskUserResponse(answers=tuple(answers))


agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-fable-5', capabilities=[AskUser(answerer=pick_first)])
```

`pick_first` stands in for a real UI. [CLAI](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/tree/main/src/pydantic_clai2/)
ships a terminal menu built on the same protocol; a web form would be another.

## Writing an answerer

An `Answerer` is one async callable: it takes an `AskUserRequest` and returns an
`AskUserResponse`. A plain `async def` qualifies; a class with `async def __call__` does too.

- `AskUserRequest.questions` holds the validated `Question` objects; `AskUserRequest.id`
  distinguishes concurrent or repeated calls so a UI can match its reply to the request.
- A completed `AskUserResponse` carries one `AskUserAnswer` per question, keyed by `header`,
  with the picked option labels in `selected`: exactly one unless the question is
  `multi_select`, at least one either way, and no label twice.
- An answerer may instead return `AskUserAnswer(header=q.header, custom_answer='My own answer')`.
  Leave `selected` empty. Custom text must be nonblank and contain no control characters
  other than newlines. The tool returns it as a one-item list under the same header;
  existing selected-label responses keep their format. The answerer, not the model's
  question schema, decides whether to offer text entry.
- When the user declines, return `AskUserResponse(cancelled=True)` with no answers. The tool
  result tells the model the user declined; nothing is raised into the run.
- A response that does not fit the request (an unknown header, a label the question did not
  offer, several labels on a single-select question, a missing answer) is a bug in the answerer
  and raises `ValueError`, which fails the run. `check_response` is exported so an answerer can
  validate before returning.

The run waits inside the tool call for the answerer to return, so a web front end that
collects the answer on another request should hold the run open until it arrives.

## Watching without answering

Two `CapabilityEvent`s let anything else in the run observe the exchange:

| Event | When | Fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AskUserRequestedEvent` | before the answerer is called | `request` |
| `AskUserAnsweredEvent` | after it returns, before the response is checked or the model sees the result | `request_id`, `response` |

Both dispatch immediately, so a listener that shows a "waiting for you" state sees the wait
start and end in step with the run. Subscribe with `@on_event` on a capability or through the
run's event stream:

```python
from pydantic_ai import RunContext
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import AbstractCapability, on_event

from pydantic_ai_harness.ask_user import AskUserAnsweredEvent, AskUserRequestedEvent


class WaitIndicator(AbstractCapability[None]):
    @on_event(AskUserRequestedEvent)
    async def waiting(self, ctx: RunContext[None], event: AskUserRequestedEvent) -> None:
        print(f'waiting on {len(event.request.questions)} question(s)')

    @on_event(AskUserAnsweredEvent)
    async def done(self, ctx: RunContext[None], event: AskUserAnsweredEvent) -> None:
        print('declined' if event.response.cancelled else 'answered')
```

## What the model sees

The tool schema mirrors Code Puppy's `ask_user_question`, so prompts written for it carry
over. Limits: 1 to 10 questions per call, unique headers of at most 25 characters, question text
of at most 500, 2 to 6 options per question with unique labels of at most 50 characters and
descriptions of at most 200; no control characters anywhere (headers and labels are one line;
question text and descriptions may span lines), since these strings are drawn on terminals and
an escape sequence in a prompt-injected call is an attack. A call outside those limits, or
carrying a field the schema does not have, is returned to the model as a validation retry,
not sent to the answerer. Once
validated the questions are frozen: what the answerer sees is what the model asked.

The result is a JSON object mapping each header to the list of picked labels (or one custom answer), or the sentence
`The user declined to answer. Continue without the answer, or ask differently if it is essential.`

The capability adds one instruction: ask when the task is ambiguous and the answer is not in
the workspace, offer concrete options, batch related questions, and make a stated choice if
the user declines.

## Two of them

`AskUser` declares no default `id`. Two on one agent collide on the `ask_user_question` tool
name: two answerers is a conflict, not one configuration stated twice.

## Tracing

`AskUser` emits no spans. Core's tool-call span already covers the wait, and the two events
above carry what was asked and answered.

## Specs

`Agent.from_spec` cannot construct `AskUser`: the answerer is a live object a spec has no way
to name.

## API reference

`check_response`, `TOOL_NAME`, `DECLINED`, and `MAX_QUESTIONS` are also exported from
`pydantic_ai_harness.ask_user`.
