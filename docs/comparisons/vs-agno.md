# Pydantic AI vs Agno

Agno is a Python agent framework that optimizes for breadth: a very large tool catalogue, teams, step workflows, and AgentOS to run and watch them. Pydantic AI gives you that breadth on a typed core with strict Pydantic validation: [capabilities](../capabilities/overview.md) and the [Harness SDK](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/) for the batteries, [sub-agents](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/subagents/) for teams, [`pydantic-graph`](../graph.md) for workflows, and [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) to run and watch them.

Pydantic AI is one part of a stack: the [Harness SDK](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/) for capabilities and complete agents, [Pydantic Evals](../evals.md), [Pydantic Graph](../graph.md), [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) for observability, and [Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/docs/validation/latest/get-started/) itself for validation. The tables below cover the whole of it.

**Already built on Agno?** The [`migrating-agno-to-pydantic-ai`](../framework-migration.md) skill ports an existing application to Pydantic AI one working path at a time, preserving behavior rather than translating API names.
