# Pydantic AI vs Claude Agent SDK

The Claude Agent SDK gives you the agent loop behind Claude Code: a Python package that drives the bundled `claude` CLI, with Anthropic's built-in tools, permissions and sub-agents already wired up. Pydantic AI gives you the loop itself: a typed [`Agent`][pydantic_ai.Agent] on [any model](../models/overview.md), and [`Coder`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/coder/) as a complete coding agent built from [capabilities](../capabilities/overview.md) you can swap, extend or leave out.

Pydantic AI is one part of a stack: the [Harness SDK](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/) for capabilities and complete agents, [Pydantic Evals](../evals.md), [Pydantic Graph](../graph.md), [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) for observability, and [Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/docs/validation/latest/get-started/) itself for validation. The tables below cover the whole of it.

**Already built on the Claude Agent SDK?** The [`migrating-claude-agent-sdk-to-pydantic-ai`](../framework-migration.md) skill ports an existing application to Pydantic AI one working path at a time, preserving behavior rather than translating API names.

## FAQ

**Can I build my own coding agent harness?** Yes. Give your agent the
[`Coder()`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/coder/) capability, or assemble your own from the
same [`Agent`][pydantic_ai.Agent]; the harness repository has a
[complete coding agent](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/blob/main/examples/coding_agent.py)
built from the pieces `Coder` puts together.

**Can I run my agents in CI?** Yes. [GitHub Agentic Workflows](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/gh-aw/) runs Pydantic AI agents
from a Markdown workflow file in GitHub Actions, or run a Python script directly with `uv run`;
nothing requires an Action.
