# Pydantic AI vs Google ADK

Google's Agent Development Kit is an agent platform built around Gemini and Vertex AI: workflow graphs, evaluation, a dev UI, and deploy commands for Cloud Run, GKE, Docker and Agent Engine. Pydantic AI is a provider-agnostic library you run on your own infrastructure, with [`pydantic-graph`](../graph.md) for workflows, [Pydantic Evals](../evals.md), a [web chat UI](../web.md), and [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) to watch it all run.

Pydantic AI is one part of a stack: the [Harness SDK](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/) for capabilities and complete agents, [Pydantic Evals](../evals.md), [Pydantic Graph](../graph.md), [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) for observability, and [Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/docs/validation/latest/get-started/) itself for validation. The tables below cover the whole of it.

**Already built on Google ADK?** The [`migrating-google-adk-to-pydantic-ai`](../framework-migration.md) skill ports an existing application to Pydantic AI one working path at a time, preserving behavior rather than translating API names.

## FAQ

**Can I build a coding agent on Pydantic AI?** Yes. Give your agent the
[`Coder()`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/coder/) capability, or assemble your own from the
same [`Agent`][pydantic_ai.Agent]; the harness repository has a
[complete coding agent](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/blob/main/examples/coding_agent.py)
built from the pieces `Coder` puts together.

**Can I run my agents in CI?** Yes. [GitHub Agentic Workflows](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/gh-aw/) runs Pydantic AI agents
from a Markdown workflow file in GitHub Actions, or run a Python script directly with `uv run`;
nothing requires an Action.
