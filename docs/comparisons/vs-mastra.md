# Pydantic AI vs Mastra

Mastra is a TypeScript agent framework with step workflows, memory, processors, evals, a local playground and a hosted Studio. Pydantic AI is that stack in Python, composed from [capabilities](../capabilities/overview.md) rather than fixed constructs: a typed [`Agent`][pydantic_ai.Agent], [memory](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/memory/), [guardrails](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/guardrails/), [Pydantic Evals](../evals.md) and a [web chat UI](../web.md).

Pydantic AI is one part of a stack: the [Harness SDK](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/) for capabilities and complete agents, [Pydantic Evals](../evals.md), [Pydantic Graph](../graph.md), [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) for observability, and [Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/docs/validation/latest/get-started/) itself for validation. The tables below cover the whole of it.

**Already built on Mastra?** The [`migrating-mastra-to-pydantic-ai`](../framework-migration.md) skill ports an existing application to Pydantic AI one working path at a time, preserving behavior rather than translating API names.
