# Pydantic AI vs CrewAI

CrewAI models an agent system as a crew: roles, tasks and a process that runs them, with `Flow` for deterministic control flow around the crew and a large first-party tool package. Pydantic AI starts from a plain typed [`Agent`][pydantic_ai.Agent] and lets you pick the orchestration: [sub-agents](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/subagents/) and [delegation](../multi-agent-applications.md) for a crew, [`pydantic-graph`](../graph.md) for a flow, and a [Harness SDK](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/) of tools and capabilities.

Pydantic AI is one part of a stack: the [Harness SDK](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/) for capabilities and complete agents, [Pydantic Evals](../evals.md), [Pydantic Graph](../graph.md), [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) for observability, and [Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/docs/validation/latest/get-started/) itself for validation. The tables below cover the whole of it.
