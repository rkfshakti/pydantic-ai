# Pydantic AI vs LangChain & LangGraph

LangChain is a large Python ecosystem: LangGraph underneath it for graph-based control flow, `deepagents` for its coding harness, and a large catalogue of integrations. Pydantic AI does it from one typed [`Agent`][pydantic_ai.Agent] with plain Python control flow: [`pydantic-graph`](../graph.md) when you want an explicit graph, a [Harness SDK](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/) of ready-made capabilities and complete agents, and validation from the library you already use.

Pydantic AI is one part of a stack: the [Harness SDK](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/) for capabilities and complete agents, [Pydantic Evals](../evals.md), [Pydantic Graph](../graph.md), [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) for observability, and [Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/docs/validation/latest/get-started/) itself for validation. The tables below cover the whole of it.

**Already built on LangChain?** The [`migrating-langchain-to-pydantic-ai`](../framework-migration.md) skill ports an existing application to Pydantic AI one working path at a time, preserving behavior rather than translating API names.

## FAQ

**Do you have a graph library?** Yes. [`pydantic-graph`](../graph.md): typed nodes, edges from return
types, and persistence for pausing and resuming. Reach for it when the control flow is a real state
machine; plain Python and [sub-agents](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/subagents/) cover the rest.
